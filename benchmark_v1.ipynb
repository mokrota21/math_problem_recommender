Show that if $\\\\varphi(n)$ divides $n-1$ and $\\\\psi(n)\\\\leq3$ , then n is prime.  \\n\\n(1998 Korean Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. Note that for prime $p$ , if $p^{2}|n$ then $p|\\\\varphi(n)$ but $p\\\\nmid n\\\\to1$ , contradiction. So we need only show that $n\\\\not=p q$ , $n\\\\ \\\\ne\\\\ p q r$ for primes $p<q<r$ .  \\n\\nFirst assume $n=p q$ , so $(p-1)(q-1)|p q-1$ .

But if $p=3$ , $q=5$ then  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{p q-1}{(p-1)(q-1)}<2;\\n$$  \\n\\nthe left side is decreasing in each variable and always $>1$ so it cannot be an integer, contradiction.  \\n\\nNow let $n=p q r$ .

Using the fact that $\\\\operatorname*{min}_{p,\\\\alpha}f(p^{\\\\alpha})=f(2)={\\\\frac{1}{2}}$ , it follows that in order to solve the given equation we need to consider the integers $p^{\\\\alpha}$ with $f(p^{\\\\alpha})\\\\leq2$ .

It is given that the reduced system of residues modn chosen from the set $\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,n-1\\\\}$ is an arithmetic progression.

The problem asks to prove that only these cases can appear.  \\n\\nLet $a_{2}$ be the second member of the progression. Because $a_{2}>1$ is the least positive number relatively prime to $n$ , it is a prime number, say $p$ and $p>3$ .

This time the second formula for $e_{p}(n)$ is useful. Of course, there is no reasonable estimation of this constant, so we should better see what happens if $a!\\\\cdot b!|n!$ .

Again this implies $e_{2}(n_{k})=e_{5}(n_{k})$ and we have seen that this gives no solution. So, actually $x=0$ .

So, $n_{k}=n_{k-1}+1$ . But then, taking into account that $n_{k}$ is a power of 5, we deduce that  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\cdot\\\\cdot(n_{k}-1)n_{k}+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+(n_{k-1}+1)\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot(n_{k}-1)n_{k}+\\\\cdot\\n$$  \\n\\nis congruent to 2 modulo 4 and thus $e_{2}(n_{k})=n+1\\\\leq e_{5}(n_{k})+1$ .

If the constellations for $a$ and $b$ have no prime in common, then the same is true of their factorizations, so $f(a b)=f(a)f(b)$ . Hence $f$ is generally multiplicative.  \\n\\nThe converse is not true. Indeed, define $g(a)$ to the product of all primes in the constellation of $a$ , taken once only, regardless of how many times they appear in the constellation. Then $g$ is clearly generally multiplicative, but $g(9)=6$ , $g(2)=2$ and $g(18)=6$ , so $g(9\\\\cdot2)\\\\neq g(9)g(2)$ .  \\n\\n2) The statement ”additive implies generally additive” can be proved in the same way.

So, let suppose $|T\\\\cap P|\\\\leq4$ . In this case, $|T\\\\cap(S\\\\setminus P)|\\\\geq217-4=213$ . Since $S$ contains 220 composite numbers, it follows that at most 7 composite numbers are not in $T$ .  \\n\\nConsider the following five-element subsets of $S\\\\setminus P$ :  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{A_{1}={\\\\{2^{\\\\cdot},3^{\\\\prime},5^{\\\\prime},7^{\\\\prime},13^{2}\\\\}}}\\\\\\\\ &{}&\\\\\\\\ &{}&{A_{2}={\\\\{2^{\\\\cdot}233^{\\\\cdot3}195:17:713\\\\}}\\\\cdot111\\\\cdot111}\\\\\\\\ &{}&\\\\\\\\ &{}&{A_{3}={\\\\{2^{\\\\cdot}2933^{\\\\cdot3}235:19:717:11\\\\cdot13\\\\}}}\\\\\\\\ &{}&\\\\\\\\ &{}&{A_{4}={\\\\{2^{\\\\cdot}315.3^{\\\\cdot2}95:23:7\\\\cdot195:11\\\\cdot171}}\\\\\\\\ &{}&\\\\\\\\ &{}&{A_{5}={\\\\{2^{\\\\cdot},37;3\\\\cdot315:7\\\\cdot295:723:11\\\\cdot19\\\\}}}\\\\\\\\ &{}&\\\\\\\\ &{}&{A_{6}={\\\\{2^{\\\\cdot}413^{\\\\cdot3}\\\\cdot375:317:793:11\\\\cdot23\\\\}}}\\\\\\\\ &{}&\\\\\\\\ &{}&{A_{7}={\\\\{2^{\\\\cdot}433^{\\\\cdot3}415:37:723:13\\\\cdot17\\\\}}}\\\\\\\\ &{}&\\\\\\\\ &{}&{A_{8}={\\\\{2^{\\\\cdot}47;3\\\\cdot33;5\\\\cdot417:3\\\\cdot12\\\\cdot19\\\\}}.}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nBy the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists a set $A_{i}$ , $1\\\\leq i\\\\leq8$ , such that $A_{i}\\\\subset T$ ; if not, the set $S\\\\backslash T$ would contain 8 composite numbers.

       "  'Problem. The numbers from 1 to 1000000 can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number from 1 to 1000000 and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Initially all of the numbers are black. Is it possible to make a sequence of moves after which all of the numbers are colored white?  \\n\\n(1999 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. It is possible. We begin by proving the following lemma:  \\n\\nLemma. Given a set $S$ of positive integers, there is a subset $T\\\\subseteq S$ such that every element of $S$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ .  \\n\\nProof. We prove the claim by induction on $|S|$ , the number of elements in $S$ . If $|S|=1$ then let $T=S$ .  \\n\\nIf $|S|>1$ , then let $\\\\alpha$ be the smallest element of $S$ . Consider the set $S^{\\\\prime}=S\\\\backslash\\\\{a\\\\}$ , the set of the largest $|S|-1$ elements in $S$ . By induction there is a subset $T^{\\\\prime}\\\\subseteq S^{\\\\prime}$ such that every element in $S^{\\\\prime}$ divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\\\prime}$ .  \\n\\nIf $a$ also divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\\\prime}$ , then the set $T=T^{\\\\prime}$ suffices. Otherwise, consider the set ${\\\\cal T}={\\\\cal T}^{\\\\prime}\\\\cup\\\\{a\\\\}$ . $a$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ . Every other element in $T$ is bigger than $a$ and can’t divide it, but divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\\\prime}=T\\\\backslash\\\\{a\\\\}$ . Hence $T$ suffices, completing the induction and the proof of the lemma. □  \\n\\nNow, write each number $n>1$ in its prime factorization  \\n\\n$$\\nn=p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot p_{k}^{a_{k}},\\n$$  \\n\\nwhere the $p_{i}$ are distinct primes and the $a_{i}$ ate positive integers. Notice that the color of $n$ will always be the same as the color of $P(n)=p_{1}p_{2}\\\\ldots p_{k}$ .  \\n\\nApply the lemma to the set $S$ consisting in all $P(i)$ for $\\\\begin{array}{r l}{i}&{{}=}\\\\end{array}$ $2,3,\\\\ldots,1000000$ to find a subset $T\\\\subset S$ such that every element of $S$  \\n\\ndivides an odd number of elements in $T$ . For each $q\\\\in S$ , let $t(q)$ equal the   \\nnumber of elements in $T$ that divides, and let $u(q)$ equal the number of $q$   \\nprimes dividing $q$ .  \\n\\nSelect all the numbers in $T$ , and consider how the color of a number $n>1$ changes. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of elements in $T$ not relatively prime to $n$ equals  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{q|P(n),q>1}(-1)^{u(q)+1}t(q).\\n$$  \\n\\nIn particular, if $q|P(n)$ is divisible by exactly $m>0$ primes, then it is counted ${\\\\binom{m}{1}}-{\\\\binom{m}{2}}+{\\\\binom{m}{3}}-\\\\cdots=1$ time in the sum. (For example, if $n\\\\ =\\\\ 6$ then the number of elements in $T$ divisible by 2 or 3 equals $t(2)+t(3)-t(6)$ .)  \\n\\nBy the definition of $T$ , each of the values $t(q)$ is odd. Because there are $2^{k}-1$ divisors $q>1$ of $P(n)$ , the above quantity is the sum of $2^{k}-1$ odd numbers and is odd itself. Therefore after selecting $T$ , every number $n>1$ will switch color an odd number of times and will turn white.  \\n\\nFinally, select 1 to turn 1 white to complete the process.  \\n\\nNote. In fact, a slight modification of the above proof shows that $T$ is unique. With some work, this stronger result implies that there is in essence exactly one way to make all the numbers white up to trivial manipulations.  \\n\\nSecond solution. Yes, it is possible. We prove a more general statement, where we replace 1000000 in the problem by some arbitrary positive integer $m$ . We also focus on the numbers divisible by just a few primes instead of all the primes.  \\n\\nLemma. For a finite set of distinct primes $S~=~\\\\{p1,p_{2},...,p_{n}\\\\}$ , let $Q_{m}(S)$ be the set of numbers between $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{Z}}$ and $m$ divisible only by primes in $S$ . The elements of $Q_{m}(S)$ can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number in $Q_{m}(S)$ and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Then it is possible to reverse the coloring of $Q_{m}(S)$ by selecting several numbers in a subset $R_{m}(S)\\\\subseteq Q_{m}(S)$ .  \\n\\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction on $n$ . If $n=1$ , then selecting $p_{1}$ suffices. Now suppose $n>1$ , and assume without loss of generality that the numbers are all black to start with.  \\n\\nLet $T=\\\\{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n-1}\\\\}$ , and define $t$ to be the largest integer such that $t p_{n}\\\\leq m$ . We can assume $t\\\\geq1$ because otherwise we could ignore $p_{n}$ and just use the smaller set $T$ , and we’d be done by our induction hypothesis.  \\n\\nNow select the numbers in $R_{m}(T),R_{t}(T)$ , and $p_{n}R_{t}(T)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\{p_{n}x|\\\\ x\\\\ \\\\in$ $R_{t}(T)\\\\}$ , and consider the effect of this action on a number $y$ :  \\n\\n$y$ is not a multiple of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. If selecting $x\\\\in R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color, selecting $x p_{n}$ will change it back so that $y$ will become white.   \\n$y$ is a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ and $R_{t}(T)$ has no effect on $y$ , but each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.   \\n$p_{n}|y$ but $y$ is not a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. Because $y\\\\neq p_{n}^{i}$ , it is divisible by some prime in $T$ so selecting the numbers in $R_{t}(T)$ makes $y$ black again. Finally, each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.  \\n\\nTherefore, all the multiples of $p_{n}$ are the same color (black if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is even, white if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is odd), while all the other numbers in $Q_{m}(S)$ are white. If the multiples of $p_{n}$ are still black, we can select $p_{n}$ to make them white, and we are done. $\\\\boxed{\\\\begin{array}{r l}\\\\end{array}}$  \\n\\nWe now return to the original problem. Set $m=1000000$ , and let $S$ be the set of all primes under 1000000. From the lemma, we can select numbers between 2 and 1000000 so that all the numbers $2,3,\\\\ldots,1000000$ are white. Finally, complete the process by selecting 1.  \\n'],\n",

Assume, by contradiction that there exists $p\\\\geq5$ such that $p^{n}=x^{3}+y^{3}$ with $x,y,n$ positive integers and $n$ of the smallest possible value.

It follows that both $x+y$ and $x^{2}-x y+y^{2}$ are divisible by $p$ . Therefore $(x+y)^{2}-(x^{2}-x y+y^{2})=3x y$ is also divisible by $p$ . However, 3 is not divisible by $p$ , so at least one of $x$ or $y$ must be divisible by $p$ . As $x+y$ is divisible by $p$ , both $x$ and $y$ are divisible by $p$ .

       "  'Problem. Let $p$ be an odd prime. The sequence $(a_{n})_{n\\\\geq0}$ is defined as follows: $a_{0}=0$ , $a_{1}=1,...$ , $a_{p-2}=p-2$ and, for all $n\\\\geq p-1$ , $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{n}$ is the least positive integer that does not form an arithmetic sequence of length $p$ with any of the preceding terms. Prove that, for all $n$ , $a_{n}$ is the number obtained by writing n in base $p-1$ and reading the result in base $p$ .  \\n\\n(1995 USA Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. Our proof uses the following result.  \\n\\nLemma. Let $B=\\\\{b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},...\\\\}$ , where $b_{n}$ is the number obtained by writing n in base $p-1$ and reading the result in base $p$ . Then  \\n\\n(a) for every $a\\\\notin B$ , there exists $d>0$ such that $a-k d\\\\in B$ for $k=$ $1,2,\\\\ldots,p-1$ ; and (b) $B$ contains no $p$ -term arithmetic progression.  \\n\\nProof. Note that $b\\\\in B$ if and only if the representation of $b$ in base $p$ does not use the digit $p-1$ .  \\n\\n(a) Since $a\\\\not\\\\in B$ , when $a$ is written in base $p$ at least one digit is $p-1$ . Let $d$ be the positive integer whose representation in base $p$ is obtained from that of $a$ by replacing each $p-1$ by $^{1}$ and each digit other than $p-1$ by 0. Then none of the numbers $a-d$ , $a-2d,\\\\ldots$ , $a-(p-1)d$ has $p-1$ as a digit when written in base $p$ , and the result follows.  \\n\\n(b) Let $a,a+d,a+2d,\\\\ldots,a+(p-1)d$ be an arbitrary $p$ -term arithmetic progression of nonnegative integers. Let $\\\\delta$ be the rightmost nonzero digit when $d$ is written in base $p$ , and let $\\\\alpha$ be the corresponding digit in the representation of $a$ . Then $\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha+\\\\delta,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha+(p-1)\\\\delta$ is a complete set of residues modulo $p$ . It follows that at least one of the numbers $a,a{+}d,\\\\ldots,a{+}$ $(p-1)d$ has $p-1$ as a digit when written in base $p$ . Hence at least one term of the given arithmetic progression does not belong to $B$ . $\\\\sqcup$  \\n\\nLet $(a_{n})_{n\\\\geq0}$ be the sequence defined in the problem. To prove that $a_{n}=$ $b_{n}$ for all $n\\\\geq0$ , we use mathematical induction. Clearly $a_{0}=b_{0}=0$ . Assume that $a_{k}=b_{k}$ for $0\\\\leq k\\\\leq n-1$ , where $n\\\\geq1$ . Then $a_{n}$ is the smallest integer greater than $b_{n-1}$ such that $\\\\{b_{0},b_{1},\\\\dotsc,b_{n-1},a_{n}\\\\}$ contains no $p$ -term arithmetic progression. By part (i) of the proposition, $a_{n}\\\\in B$ so $a_{n}\\\\geq b_{n}$ . By part (ii) of the proposition, the choice of $a_{n}=b_{n}$ does not yield a $p$ -term arithmetic progression with any of the preceding terms. It follows by induction that $a_{n}=b_{n}$ for all $n\\\\geq0$ .  \\n\\n',\n",
       "  'Problem. Suppose that $x,y$ and $z$ are natural numbers such that $x y=z^{2}+1$ . Prove that there exist integers $a,b,c$ and $d$ such that $x=a^{2}+b^{2}$ , $y=c^{2}+d^{2}$ , and $z=a c+b d$ .  \\n\\n(Euler’s problem)  \\n\\nSolution. We prove the claim by strong induction on $z$ . For $z=1$ , we have $(x,y)=(1,2)$ or (2,1); in the former (resp. latter) case, we can set $(a,b,c,d)=(1,0,1,1)$ (resp. (0,1,1,1)).  \\n\\nSuppose that the claim is true whenever $z~<~z_{0}$ , and that we wish to prove it for $(x,y,z)=(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ where $x_{0}y_{0}=z_{0}^{2}+1$ . Without loss of generality, assume that $x_{0}\\\\leq y_{0}$ . Consider the triple $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})=(x_{0},x_{0}+$ $y_{0}-2z_{0},z_{0}-x_{0}\\\\big)$ , so that $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})=(x_{1},x_{1}+y_{1}+2z_{1},x_{1}+z_{1})$ .  \\n\\nFirst, using the fact that $x_{0}y_{0}=z_{0}^{2}+1$ , it is easy to check that $(x,y,z)=$ $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ satisfies $x y=z^{2}+1$ .  \\n\\nSecond, we claim that $x_{1},y_{1},z_{1}>0$ . This is obvious for $x_{1}$ . Next, note that $y_{1}=x_{0}+y_{0}-2z_{0}\\\\geq2{\\\\sqrt{x_{0}y_{0}}}-2z_{0}>2z_{0}-2z_{0}=0$ . Finally, because $x_{0}\\\\leq y_{0}$ and $x_{0}y_{0}=z_{0}^{2}+1$ , we have $x_{0}\\\\leq\\\\sqrt{z_{0}^{2}+1}$ , or $x_{0}\\\\le z_{0}$ . However, $x_{0}\\\\neq z_{0}$ , because this would imply that $z_{0}y_{0}=z_{0}^{2}+1$ , but $z_{0}\\\\uparrow(z_{0}^{2}+1)$ when $z_{0}>1$ . Thus, $z_{0}-x_{0}>0$ , or $z_{1}>0$ .  \\n\\nTherefore, $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ is a triple of positive integers $(x,y,z)$ satisfying $x y=z^{2}+1$ and with $z<z_{0}$ . By the induction hypothesis, we can write $x_{1}=a^{2}+b^{2}$ , $y_{1}=c^{2}+d^{2}$ and $z_{1}=a c+b d$ . Then  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{r l}&{(a c+b d)^{2}=z_{1}^{2}=x_{1}y_{1}-1}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\qquad=(a^{2}+b^{2})(c^{2}+d^{2})-1}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\qquad=(a^{2}c^{2}+b^{2}d^{2}+2a b c d)+(a^{2}d^{2}+b^{2}c^{2}-2a b c d)-1}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\qquad=(a c+b d)^{2}(a d-b c)^{2}-1,}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nso that $|a d-b c|=1$ .  \\n\\nNow, note that $x_{0}=x_{1}=a^{2}+b^{2}$ and $y_{0}=x_{1}+y_{1}+2z_{1}=a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+$ $2(a c+b d)=(a+c)^{2}+(b+d)^{2}$ . In other words, $x_{0}={a^{\\\\prime}}^{2}+{b^{\\\\prime}}^{2}$ and $y_{0}={c^{\\\\prime}}^{2}+{d^{\\\\prime}}^{2}$ for $(a^{\\\\prime},b^{\\\\prime},c^{\\\\prime},d^{\\\\prime})=(a,b,a+c,b+d)$ . Then $|a^{\\\\prime}d^{\\\\prime}-b^{\\\\prime}c^{\\\\prime}|=|a d-b c|=1$ , implying (by logic analogous to the reasoning in the previous paragraph) that $z_{0}=a^{\\\\prime}c^{\\\\prime}+b^{\\\\prime}d^{\\\\prime}$ , as desired.

Let $e$ be the highest exponent such that $p^{e}$ divides $b$ , and let $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ be the corresponding highest exponents for $a$ and $c$ , respectively.

Then from the above equation, it follows that $a_{g c d(r,k)}>$ $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{g c d(r,s)}$ , so that $g c d(r,k)~>~g c d(r,s)$ .

If $n$ is a multiple of 10, then the last digit of any multiple of $n$ is $0$ . Hence it is not wobbly.

In particular, $x_{2}$ is a wobbly multiple of $m$ . If $m$ is divisible by 5, then $5x_{2}$ is a wobbly multiple of $m$ .  \\n\\nNext, we consider powers of 2. We prove by induction on $t$ that $2^{2t+1}$ has a wobbly multiple $w_{t}$ with precisely $t$ non-zero digits. For $t=1$ , take $w_{1}=8$ . Suppose $w_{t}$ exists for some $t\\\\geq1$ .

Clearly, $w_{t+1}$ is wobbly, and has precisely $t+1$ non-zero digits.

If $a$ is the sum of the odd interior places and $b$ the sum of the even places, we have $a+b=67$ and $a-b\\\\equiv-3$ (mod 11). Since $a-b$ must also be odd, we have $a-b\\\\ge7$ or $a-b\\\\leq-15$ , and so either $a\\\\geq37$ or $b\\\\geq41$ , contradicting the fact that $a$ and $b$ are each the sum of four digits.  \\n\\nNow suppose the number has 9 interior digits.

The courageous reader may try to prove that there are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive numbers which are not Niven numbers (which is easily implied by the above result; yet there is an elementary proof of the last assertion). For more details one can read the article ”Large and small gaps between consecutive Niven numbers”, Journal of Integer Sequences, Vol.6(2003), by J.-M. Koninck and N. Doyon.  \\n'],\n",

We will solve the problem in two steps.  \\n\\nFirst step. The number $2a b c-a b-b c-c a$ cannot be expressed in the required form. Assume contrary, that:  \\n\\n$$\\n2a b c-a b-b c-c a=x b c+y c a+z a b,\\n$$  \\n\\nwhere $x,y,z\\\\geq0$ .

Any number $N$ , $N>2a b c-a b-b c-c a$ , can be expressed in the form $N=x b c+y c a+z a b$ .  \\n\\nFirst, observe that $2a b c-a b-b c-c a+1>0$ . It follows by the following argument:  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{a b c}(2a b c-a b-b c-c a+1)=2-\\\\frac{1}{a}-\\\\frac{1}{b}-\\\\frac{1}{c}+\\\\frac{1}{a b c}>2-\\\\frac{1}{1}-\\\\frac{1}{2}-\\\\frac{1}{3}+\\\\frac{1}{a b c}>0.\\n$$  \\n\\nGoing further, we have two situations. When $N\\\\equiv0$ (mod abc), since $N=a b c q$ , we may consider the combination $N=(a b)c q+b c\\\\cdot0+c a\\\\cdot0$ . It is of required form, under notations $x=y=0$ and $z=c q$ .  \\n\\nSuppose that $N\\\\not\\\\equiv0$ (mod $a b c$ ). Because $g c d(b c,a)=1$ , the congruence  \\n\\n$$\\nx b c\\\\equiv N{\\\\pmod{a}}\\n$$  \\n\\nhas a solution $x_{0}$ , $0<x_{0}<a$ . Similarly, the congruences  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{c c}{{y c a\\\\equiv N}}&{{(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ b)}}\\\\\\\\ {{}}&{{}}\\\\\\\\ {{z a b\\\\equiv N}}&{{(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ c)}}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nhave solutions $y_{0},z_{0}$ , respectively, $0<y_{0}<b$ , $0<x_{0}<c$ .  \\n\\nLet $A=x_{0}b c+y_{0}c a+z_{0}a b$ .

Since $x_{0}~\\\\leq~a-1$ , $y_{0}\\\\leq b-1$ , and $z_{0}\\\\le c-1$ it follows that $A\\\\leq3a b c-b c-c a-a b$ . Using $A\\\\equiv N$ (mod abc), we may write $N=A+k a b c$ . In this sum $k\\\\geq0$ , since $N>2a b c-b c-c a-a b$ .

Given a prime $p$ and a positive integer $k>1$ , if $k$ and $p-1$ are relatively prime then $x^{k}\\\\equiv y^{k}{\\\\pmod{p}}\\\\Rightarrow x\\\\equiv y$ (mod $p$ ) for all $x,y$ .  \\n\\nProof. If $y\\\\equiv0$ (mod $p$ ) the claim is obvious. Otherwise, note that $x^{k}\\\\equiv y^{k}\\\\Rightarrow(x y^{-1})^{k}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ), so it suffices to prove that $a^{k}\\\\equiv1$ $({\\\\bmod{p}})\\\\Rightarrow a\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ).  \\n\\nBecause $\\\\begin{array}{r}{g c d(p-1,k)=1}\\\\end{array}$ , there exist integers $b$ and $c$ such that $b(p\\\\mathrm{~-~}$ $1)+c k=1$ . Thus, $a^{k}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{p}}\\\\Rightarrow a^{c}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{p}}\\\\Rightarrow a^{1-b(p-1)}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). If $a=0$ this is impossible. Otherwise, by Fermat’s Little Theorem, $(a^{-b})^{p-1}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ) so that $a\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ), as desired.  \\n\\nAlternatively, again note that clearly $a\\\\ \\\\not\\\\equiv\\\\ 0$ (mod $p$ ). Then let $d$ be the order of $a$ , the smallest positive integer such that $\\\\boldsymbol{a}^{d}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ); we have $d|k$ . Take the set $\\\\{1,a,a^{2},\\\\ldots,a^{d-1}\\\\}$ . If it does not contain all of $1,2,\\\\ldots,p\\\\mathrm{~-~}1$ then pick some other element $b$ and consider the set $\\\\{b,b a,b a^{2},\\\\ldots,b a^{d-1}\\\\}$ . These two sets are disjoint, because otherwise $b a^{i}\\\\equiv a^{j}\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ b\\\\equiv a^{j-1}$ (mod $p$ ), a contradiction. Continuing similarly, we can partition $\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,p{-}1\\\\}$ into $d$ -element subsets, and hence $d|p{-}1$ . However, $d|k$ and $\\\\begin{array}{r}{g c d(k,p-1)=1}\\\\end{array}$ , implying that $d=1$ . Therefore $a\\\\equiv a^{d}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ), as desired. □  \\n\\nBecause $3|p-2,g c d(3,p-1)=1$ . Then from the claim, it follows that the set of elements $\\\\{1^{3},2^{3},\\\\dots,p^{3}\\\\}$ equals $\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,p\\\\}$ modulo $p$ . Hence, for each $y$ with $0\\\\leq y\\\\leq p-1$ , there is exactly one $x$ between $0$ and $p-1$ such that $x^{3}\\\\equiv y^{2}-1$ (mod $p$ ): that is, such that $p|y^{2}-x^{3}-1$ . Therefore $S$ contains at most $p$ elements divisible by $p$ , as desired.  \\n\\n# Proposed problems  \\n\\n',\n",

Then the above equality implies that $p$ divides $q2^{k(q-1)}$ . On the other hand, $p$ is obviously odd and hence it divides $q$ . Being a prime, $q$ must be then equal to $p$ . Therefore $n=k q=k p$ and $p^{\\\\alpha}=(3^{p})^{k}-(2^{p})^{k}$ is divisible by $3^{p}-3^{p}$ , implying $3^{p}-2^{p}=p^{\\\\gamma}$ for some $\\\\gamma\\\\geq1$ .

The solution is the set of all $(p,p-1)$ , for odd primes $p$ . The fact that all of these pairs are indeed solutions follows immediately from Fermat’s Little Theorem. Now we show that no other solutions exist.  \\n\\nSuppose that $(m,n)$ is a solution. Let $p$ be a prime dividing $m$ . We first observe that $p>n$ . Otherwise, we could take $a=p$ , and then $p^{n}-1$ would not be divisible by $p$ , and alone $m$ .

If $n$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even and less than $p$ . Otherwise, if $n$ is even, then $n+2$ is even and hence less than $p$ as well, because $p$ is odd.

Because $n<d<p<m$ , we see that $1,2,\\\\ldots,n,d$ are $n+1$ distinct roots of the polynomial congruence $x^{n}-1\\\\equiv0$ (mod $p$ ). By Lagrange’s Theorem, however, this congruence can have at most $n$ roots, a contradiction.  \\n\\nThus, we have sandwiched $p$ between $n$ and $n{\\\\mathrel{+{2}}}$ , and the only possibility is that $p=n+1$ .

So, let us take a prime $q|f_{p}(m)$ for a certain positive integer $m$ divisible by $p$ . Then we have of course $q|m^{p}-1$ . But this implies that $o_{\\\\boldsymbol q}(m)|\\\\boldsymbol q$ and consequently $o_{q}(m)\\\\in\\\\{1,p\\\\}$ . If $o_{q}(m)~=~p$ , then $q\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). Otherwise, $q|m-$  \\n\\n1 and because $q|f_{p}(m)$ , we deduce that $q|p$ , hence $q\\\\ =\\\\ p$ . But we have seen while solving a) that this is not possible, so the only choice is $p|q-$ 1. Now, we need to find a sequence $(m_{k})_{k\\\\geq1}$ of multiples of $p$ such that $f_{p}(m_{k})$ are pairwise relatively prime. This is not as easy as in the first example. Anyway, just by trial and error, it is not difficult to find such a sequence. There are many other approaches, but we like the following one: take $m_{1}=p$ and $m_{k}=p f(m_{1})f_{p}(m_{2})\\\\ldots f_{p}(m_{k-1})$ . Let us prove that $f_{p}(m_{k})$ is relatively prime to $f_{p}(m_{1}),f_{p}(m_{2}),\\\\ldots,f_{p}(m_{k-1})$ . Fortunately, this is easy, since $f_{p}(m_{1})f_{p}(m_{2})\\\\ldots f_{p}(m_{k-1})|f_{p}(m_{k})-f_{p}(0)|f_{p}(m_{k})-1$ . The solution ends here.  \\n\\n',\n",

But this is not difficult, because for all $i\\\\geq0$ the number $17^{2^{t}}+1$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. Thus, $v_{2}(17^{2^{k}}-1)=4+k$ and the order is found by solving the equation $k+4=2005$ . Thus, $O_{2^{2005}}(17)=2^{2001}$ is the answer to the problem.  \\n\\n',\n",
       "  'Problem. Find all prime numbers $p,q$ such that $p^{2}+1|2003^{q}+1$ and $q^{2}+1|2003^{p}+1$ .  \\n\\nSolution. Let us suppose that $p\\\\leq q$ . We discuss first the trivial case $p=2$ . In this case, $5|2003^{q}+1$ and it is easy to deduce that $q$ is even, hence $q=2$ , which is a solution of the problem. Now, suppose that $p>2$ and let $r$ be a prime factor of $p^{2}+1$ . Because $r|2003^{2q}\\\\mathrm{~-~}1$ , it follows that $o_{r}(2003)|2q$ . Suppose that $(q,o_{r}(2003))=1$ . Then $o_{r}(2003)|2$ and $r|2003^{2}-1=2^{3}\\\\cdot3\\\\cdot7\\\\cdot11\\\\cdot13\\\\cdot167$ . It seems that this is a dead end, since there are too many possible values for $r$ . Another simple observation narrows the number of possible cases: because $r|p^{2}+1$ , must be of the form $4k+1$ or equal to 2 and now we do not have many possibilities: $r\\\\in\\\\{2,13\\\\}$ . The case $r=13$ is also impossible, because $2003^{q}+1\\\\equiv2$ (mod 13) and $r|2003^{q}+1$ . So, we have found that for any prime factor $r$ of $p^{2}+1$ , we have either $r=2$ or $q|o_{r}(2003)$ , which in turn implies $q|r-1$ . Because $p^{2}+1$ is even, but not divisible by 4 and because any odd prime factor of it is congruent to 1 modulo $q$ , we must have $p^{2}+1\\\\equiv2$ (mod $q$ ). This implies that $p^{2}+1\\\\equiv2$ (mod $q$ ), that is $q|(p-1)(p+1)$ . Combining this with the assumption that $p\\\\leq q$ yields $q|p+1$ and in fact $q=p+1$ .

It is quite clear that $p,q,r$ are distinct. Indeed, if for example $p=q$ , then the relation $p|q^{r}+1$ is impossible. We will prove that we cannot have $p,q,r>2$ . Suppose this is the case. The first condition $p|q^{r}+1$ implies $p|q^{2r}-1$ and so $o_{p}(q)|2r$ . If $o_{p}(q)$ is odd, it follows that $p|q^{r}-1$ , which combined with $p|q^{r}+1$ yields $p=2$ , which is impossible. Thus, $o_{p}(q)$ is either 2 or $2r$ . Could we have $o_{p}(q)=2r$ ? No, since this would imply that $2r|p-1$ and so $0\\\\equiv p^{q}+1$ ( $\\\\mod r)\\\\equiv2$ (mod $r$ ), that is $r\\\\ =\\\\ 2$ , false. Therefore, the only possibility is $o_{p}(q)=2$ and so $p|q^{2}-1$ . We cannot have p|q − 1, because p|qr + 1 and p ̸= 2. Thus, p|q + 1 and in fact p| q +2 1 . In the same way, we find that $q|\\\\frac{r+1}{2}$ and r p + 1 . $r|\\\\frac{p+1}{2}$ This is clearly impossible, just by looking at the largest among $p,q,r$ . So, our assumption was wrong and indeed one of the three primes must equal 2. Suppose without loss of generality that $p=2$ . Then $q$ is odd, $q|r^{2}+1$ and $r|2^{q}+1$ . Similarly, $o_{r}(2)|2q$ . If $q|o_{r}(2)$ , then $q|r-1$ and so $q|r^{2}+1-(r^{2}-1)=2$ , which contradicts the already established result that $q$ is odd. Thus, $o_{r}(2)|2$ and $r|3$ . As a matter of fact, this implies that $r=3$ and $q=5$ , yielding the triple (2,5,3). It is immediate to verify that this triple satisfies all conditions of the problem. Moreover, all solutions are given by cyclic permutations of the components of this triple.  \\n\\n',\n",

In this way by descending method $(n,m)\\\\to(m,n-m)$ or by ascending method $(a,b)\\\\rightarrow(a+b,a)$ , we obtain new solutions of the equation. The ascending and descending methods are reverse to one another.  \\n\\nBy applying the descending method to a pair $(n,m)\\\\in S$ we can have only finitely many steps, because $n-m<m$ . Hence, in a finite number of steps we obtain a pair with $\\\\mathit{n}=\\\\mathit{m}_{\\\\mathit{n}}$ , that is the pair (1,1). Thus, all solutions $(n,m)\\\\in S$ are obtained from the pair (1,0) by applying the ascending method:  \\n\\n$$\\n(1,0)\\\\rightarrow(1,1)\\\\rightarrow(2,1)\\\\rightarrow(3,2)\\\\rightarrow(5,3)\\\\rightarrow...\\n$$  \\n\\nThe components of all such pairs are Fibonacci numbers $F_{n}$ .

For $n\\\\leq2000$ , if $a_{n}$ is not an integer, $a_{n}=p_{n}/q_{n}$ , where $p_{n}$ and $q_{n}$ are positive odd integers, $(p,q)=1$ and $q>1$ .  \\n\\nProof. We proceed by using induction. Case case: $n=2000$ . a2000 is either $5/7$ or $1/5$ . Suppose $a_{n+1}=p/q$ . Then:  \\n\\nCase $\\\\mathit{1}$ . $a_{n}=2p/q+1$ . Then $a_{n}=(2p+q)/q$ . Suppose $d|(2p+q)$ and $d|q$ . Then $d|(2p+q-q)$ or $d|2p$ . Since is odd, $d$ must also be odd. So $q$ $(d,2)=1$ and therefore $d|p$ . Because $d|p,d|q$ , and $(p,q)=1$ , $d$ must equal 1. Therefore $(2p+q,q)=1$ and since $2p+q\\\\mathrm{a}$ and $q$ are both odd as well, $a_{n}$ satisfies the conditions stated in the lemma, thus completing the inductive step.  \\n\\nCase 2. an = p / $a_{n}=\\\\frac{p}{q}/\\\\left(2+\\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{p}{2q+p}$ . Again suppose d divides both the numerator $p$ and denominator $2p+q$ . Then $d|(2p+q-p)$ or $d|2q$ . But since $p$ is odd, $d$ is odd, and so $d|q$ . Because $(p,q)=1$ , $d$ is equal to 1 and so $(p,2q+p)=1$ . Since $p$ and $2q+p$ are odd and are relatively prime, $a_{n}$ satisfies the conditions and completes the proof.  \\n\\nWe must now only consider the case where $a_{2001}=1/2$ . In this case, $a_{2000}$ is either 2 or $5/7$ . If it is 2, the conditions of the problem are violated.

Also, $d|n$ , implying that the numerator is the product of various $a_{m}$ such that $m|n$ . For fixed $m$ that divides $n$ , how many times does $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator $\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}E_{d}$ of (∗)?  \\n\\nIf $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ and $d|n$ , then let $t=d/m$ . By the definition of $E_{d}$ , we know that (i) $t$ is square-free and (ii) $t$ has an even number of prime factors. Because $d|n$ and $t=d/m$ , we further know that (iii) $t$ divides $n/m$ .  \\n\\nConversely, suppose that $t$ is any positive integer satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), and write $d=t m$ . By (iii), $d$ is a divisor of $n$ . Also, $t$ is square-free by (i), is a divisor of $d$ , and has an even number of prime factors by (ii).

For each positive integer $n$ , $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer.  \\n\\nProof. Fix $n$ . Call an integer $d$ a top divisor (resp. a bottom divisor) if $d|n,n/d$ is square-free, and $n/d$ has an even (resp. odd) number of prime factors. By definition, $E_{d}$ is the product of $\\\\mathit{a}_{d}$ over all top divisors $d$ , and $O_{d}$ is the product of $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{d}$ over all bottom divisors $d$ .  \\n\\nFix any prime $p$ . We show that $p$ divides $E_{n}$ at least as many times as it divides $O_{n}$ . To do this, it suffices to show the following for any positive integer $k$ :  \\n\\n(1) The number of top divisors $d$ with $\\\\boldsymbol a_{n/d}$ divisible by $p^{k}$ is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ with divisible by $p^{k}$ . $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$  \\n\\nLet $k$ be any positive integer. If $p^{k}$ divides none of $a_{1},a_{2},\\\\dotsc$ , then (1) holds trivially. Otherwise, by the previous lemma, there exists an integer $d_{0}$ such that  \\n\\n$$\\np^{k}|a_{m}\\\\ \\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\ d_{0}|m.\\n$$  \\n\\nHence, to show (1) it suffices to show:  \\n\\n(2) The number of top divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ , is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ .  \\n\\nIf $d_{0}\\\\nmid n$ , then (2) holds because $d_{0}$ does not divide $n/d$ for any divisor $d$ of $n$ , including top or bottom divisors.  \\n\\nOtherwise, $d_{0}|n$ . For which top and bottom divisors $d$ does $d_{0}$ divide $n/d$ ? Precisely those for which $d$ divides $n/d_{0}$ . If $n/d_{0}$ has $l\\\\geq1$ distinct prime factors, then there are as many top divisors with this property as there are bottom divisors, namely  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\\\binom{l}{2}}+\\\\cdots=2^{l-1}={\\\\binom{l}{1}}+{\\\\binom{l}{3}}+\\\\ldots\\n$$  \\n\\nIf instead $d_{0}=n$ and $\\\\mathit{l}\\\\mathit{\\\\Theta}=0$ , then the top divisor 1 is the only value $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ . In either case, there are at least as many top divisors $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ as there are bottom divisors with the same property. Therefore, (2) holds. This completes the proof. □  \\n\\nTherefore, $a_{n}=\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}b_{d}$ , and $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer for each $n$ .  \\n\\nAlternative solution.

With the substitution $x={\\frac{a}{p^{k}}},y={\\frac{b}{p^{k}}}$ k , we have to prove that for any nonnegative real numbers $x,y$ we have  \n\n$$\n+\\lfloor2y\\rfloor\\geq\\lfloor2x+3y\\rfloor+\\lfloor x+2y\\rfloor+\\lfloor x+y\\rfloor+\\lfloor x\\rfloor+2{\\left\\lfloor y\\right.}\n$$  \n\nThis isn’t easy, but with another useful idea the inequality will become easy.

         "Problem. The numbers from 1 to 1000000 can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number from 1 to 1000000 and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Initially all of the numbers are black. Is it possible to make a sequence of moves after which all of the numbers are colored white?  \n\n(1999 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \n\nSolution. It is possible. We begin by proving the following lemma:  \n\nLemma. Given a set $S$ of positive integers, there is a subset $T\\subseteq S$ such that every element of $S$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ .  \n\nProof. We prove the claim by induction on $|S|$ , the number of elements in $S$ . If $|S|=1$ then let $T=S$ .  \n\nIf $|S|>1$ , then let $\\alpha$ be the smallest element of $S$ . Consider the set $S^{\\prime}=S\\backslash\\{a\\}$ , the set of the largest $|S|-1$ elements in $S$ . By induction there is a subset $T^{\\prime}\\subseteq S^{\\prime}$ such that every element in $S^{\\prime}$ divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\prime}$ .  \n\nIf $a$ also divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\prime}$ , then the set $T=T^{\\prime}$ suffices. Otherwise, consider the set ${\\cal T}={\\cal T}^{\\prime}\\cup\\{a\\}$ . $a$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ . Every other element in $T$ is bigger than $a$ and can’t divide it, but divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\prime}=T\\backslash\\{a\\}$ . Hence $T$ suffices, completing the induction and the proof of the lemma. □  \n\nNow, write each number $n>1$ in its prime factorization  \n\n$$\nn=p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot p_{k}^{a_{k}},\n$$  \n\nwhere the $p_{i}$ are distinct primes and the $a_{i}$ ate positive integers. Notice that the color of $n$ will always be the same as the color of $P(n)=p_{1}p_{2}\\ldots p_{k}$ .  \n\nApply the lemma to the set $S$ consisting in all $P(i)$ for $\\begin{array}{r l}{i}&{{}=}\\end{array}$ $2,3,\\ldots,1000000$ to find a subset $T\\subset S$ such that every element of $S$  \n\ndivides an odd number of elements in $T$ . For each $q\\in S$ , let $t(q)$ equal the   \nnumber of elements in $T$ that divides, and let $u(q)$ equal the number of $q$   \nprimes dividing $q$ .  \n\nSelect all the numbers in $T$ , and consider how the color of a number $n>1$ changes. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of elements in $T$ not relatively prime to $n$ equals  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{q|P(n),q>1}(-1)^{u(q)+1}t(q).\n$$  \n\nIn particular, if $q|P(n)$ is divisible by exactly $m>0$ primes, then it is counted ${\\binom{m}{1}}-{\\binom{m}{2}}+{\\binom{m}{3}}-\\cdots=1$ time in the sum. (For example, if $n\\ =\\ 6$ then the number of elements in $T$ divisible by 2 or 3 equals $t(2)+t(3)-t(6)$ .)  \n\nBy the definition of $T$ , each of the values $t(q)$ is odd. Because there are $2^{k}-1$ divisors $q>1$ of $P(n)$ , the above quantity is the sum of $2^{k}-1$ odd numbers and is odd itself. Therefore after selecting $T$ , every number $n>1$ will switch color an odd number of times and will turn white.  \n\nFinally, select 1 to turn 1 white to complete the process.  \n\nNote. In fact, a slight modification of the above proof shows that $T$ is unique. With some work, this stronger result implies that there is in essence exactly one way to make all the numbers white up to trivial manipulations.  \n\nSecond solution. Yes, it is possible. We prove a more general statement, where we replace 1000000 in the problem by some arbitrary positive integer $m$ . We also focus on the numbers divisible by just a few primes instead of all the primes.  \n\nLemma. For a finite set of distinct primes $S~=~\\{p1,p_{2},...,p_{n}\\}$ , let $Q_{m}(S)$ be the set of numbers between $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ and $m$ divisible only by primes in $S$ . The elements of $Q_{m}(S)$ can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number in $Q_{m}(S)$ and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Then it is possible to reverse the coloring of $Q_{m}(S)$ by selecting several numbers in a subset $R_{m}(S)\\subseteq Q_{m}(S)$ .  \n\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction on $n$ . If $n=1$ , then selecting $p_{1}$ suffices. Now suppose $n>1$ , and assume without loss of generality that the numbers are all black to start with.  \n\nLet $T=\\{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n-1}\\}$ , and define $t$ to be the largest integer such that $t p_{n}\\leq m$ . We can assume $t\\geq1$ because otherwise we could ignore $p_{n}$ and just use the smaller set $T$ , and we’d be done by our induction hypothesis.  \n\nNow select the numbers in $R_{m}(T),R_{t}(T)$ , and $p_{n}R_{t}(T)\\ =\\ \\{p_{n}x|\\ x\\ \\in$ $R_{t}(T)\\}$ , and consider the effect of this action on a number $y$ :  \n\n$y$ is not a multiple of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. If selecting $x\\in R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color, selecting $x p_{n}$ will change it back so that $y$ will become white.   \n$y$ is a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ and $R_{t}(T)$ has no effect on $y$ , but each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.   \n$p_{n}|y$ but $y$ is not a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. Because $y\\neq p_{n}^{i}$ , it is divisible by some prime in $T$ so selecting the numbers in $R_{t}(T)$ makes $y$ black again. Finally, each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.  \n\nTherefore, all the multiples of $p_{n}$ are the same color (black if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is even, white if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is odd), while all the other numbers in $Q_{m}(S)$ are white. If the multiples of $p_{n}$ are still black, we can select $p_{n}$ to make them white, and we are done. $\\boxed{\\begin{array}{r l}\\end{array}}$  \n\nWe now return to the original problem. Set $m=1000000$ , and let $S$ be the set of all primes under 1000000. From the lemma, we can select numbers between 2 and 1000000 so that all the numbers $2,3,\\ldots,1000000$ are white. Finally, complete the process by selecting 1.  \n"

         "Problem. Find all primes $p$ for which there exist positive integers $x,y$ and n such that $p^{n}=x^{3}+y^{3}$ .  \n\n(2000 Hungarian Mathematical Olympiad)  \n\nSolution. Observe $2^{1}=1^{3}+1^{3}$ and $3^{2}=2^{3}+1^{3}$ . We will prove that the only answers are $p=2$ or $p=3$ . Assume, by contradiction that there exists $p\\geq5$ such that $p^{n}=x^{3}+y^{3}$ with $x,y,n$ positive integers and $n$ of the smallest possible value. Hence at least one of $x$ and $y$ is greater than 1. We have $x^{3}+y^{3}=(x+y)(x^{2}-x y+y^{2})$ with $x+y\\ge3$ and $x^{2}-x y+y^{2}=(x-y)^{2}+x y\\ge2$ . It follows that both $x+y$ and $x^{2}-x y+y^{2}$ are divisible by $p$ . Therefore $(x+y)^{2}-(x^{2}-x y+y^{2})=3x y$ is also divisible by $p$ . However, 3 is not divisible by $p$ , so at least one of $x$ or $y$ must be divisible by $p$ . As $x+y$ is divisible by $p$ , both $x$ and $y$ are divisible by $p$ . Then $x^{3}+y^{3}\\ge2p^{3}$ and necessarily $n>3$ . We obtain  \n\n$$\np^{n-3}={\\frac{p^{n}}{p^{3}}}={\\frac{x^{3}}{p^{3}}}+{\\frac{y^{3}}{p^{3}}}=\\left({\\frac{x}{p}}\\right)^{3}+\\left({\\frac{y}{p}}\\right)^{3},\n$$  \n\nand this contradicts the minimality of $n$ (see the remark after FMID Variant 1).  \n"

Strengthening the statement, by imposing the condition that one of the $n$ divisors should be 1, puts us in a winning position. The question here is how we came to think of this. Well, there is just about one way to go in using the induction hypothesis $n!=d_{1}+d_{2}+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+d_{n}$ (where $d_{1},d_{2},\\ldots,d_{n}$ are the $n$ divisors arranged in increasing order); namely, multiplying the above relation by $n+1$ .

Prove that for each natural number $n$ , $n\\geq2$ , there is a natural number $x$ for which $f(x)$ is divisible by $3^{n}$ but not by 3n+1.  \n\n(1999 Japanese Mathematical Olympiad)  \n\nSolution. We prove the result by induction on $n$ . If $n=2$ , then $x=1$ suffices. Now suppose that the claim is true for $n\\geq2$ , that is, there is a natural number $y$ such that $y^{3}+17$ is divisible by $3^{n}$ but not $3^{n+1}$ . We prove that the claim is true for $n+1$ .  \n\nSuppose we have integers $a,m$ such that $a$ is not divisible by 3 and $m\\geq2$ . Then $a^{2}\\equiv1$ (mod 3) and thus $3^{m}a^{2}\\equiv3^{m}$ (mod $3^{m+1}$ ). Also, because $m\\geq2$ we have $3m-3\\geq2m-1\\geq m+1$ . Hence  \n\n$$\n(a+3^{m-1})^{3}\\equiv a^{3}+3^{m}a^{2}+3^{2m-1}a+3^{3m-3}\\equiv a^{3}+3^{m}{\\pmod{3^{m+1}}}.\n$$  \n\nBecause $y^{3}+17$ is divisible by $3^{n}$ , it is congruent to either $0$ , $3^{n}$ , or $2\\cdot3^{n}$ modulo $3^{n+1}$ . Because 3 does not divide 17, 3 cannot divide $y$ either. Hence applying our result from the previous paragraph twice, once with $(a,m)=(y,n)$ and once with $(a,m)=(y+3^{n-1},n)$ , we find that $3^{n+1}$ must divide either $(y+3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ or $(y+2\\cdot3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ .  \n\nHence there exists a natural number $x^{\\prime}$ not divisible by 3 such that $3^{n+1}|{x^{\\prime}}^{3}+17$ . If $3^{n+2}$ does not divide ${x^{\\prime}}^{3}+17$ , we are done. Otherwise, we claim the number $x=x^{\\prime}+3^{n}$ suffices. Because $x=x^{\\prime}+3^{n-1}+3^{n-1}+3^{n-1}$ , the result from previous the paragraphs tells us that $x^{3}\\equiv{x^{\\prime}}^{3}+3^{n}+$ $3^{n}+3^{n}\\equiv x^{\\prime3}$ (mod $3^{n+1}$ ). Thus $3^{n+1}|x^{3}+17$ as well. On the other hand, because $x=x^{\\prime}+3^{n}$ , we have $x^{3}\\equiv{x^{\\prime}}^{3}+3^{n+1}\\not\\equiv{x^{\\prime}}^{3}$ (mod $3^{n+2}$ ). It follows that $3^{n+2}$ does not divide $x^{3}+17$ , as desired. This completes the inductive step.  \n\n# Proposed problems  \n\n"

Let $\\delta$ be the rightmost nonzero digit when $d$ is written in base $p$ , and let $\\alpha$ be the corresponding digit in the representation of $a$ .

It follows that at least one of the numbers $a,a{+}d,\\ldots,a{+}$ $(p-1)d$ has $p-1$ as a digit when written in base $p$ .

So, $n_{k}=n_{k-1}+1$ .

Since $n_{k}$ is a power of 5, we find that $n_{k}=5$ , $n_{k-1}=$ and a quick research of all possibilities shows that there are no solutions.  \\n',\n",

Now we apply (1). The even divisors of $n$ do not influence its left-hand side. Each divisor of the form $4k+1$ contributes a 1, and each divisor of the form $4k+3$ contributes $a-1$ . Consequently, it suffices to prove that the summation function of $f,\\\\sum_{d\\\\mid n}f(d)$ is nonnegative for each positive integer $n$ .  \\n\\nTake any prime divisor $p_{i}$ of $n$ . If $p_{i}\\\\equiv1$ (mod 4), then the same congruence holds for all powers of $p_{i}$ , so the $\\\\textit{\\\\textbf{\\\\i}}$ th factor in the right-hand side of (1) is positive. If $p_{i}$ is congruent to 3 modulo 4, then so are its odd powers while the even powers are congruent to 1 modulo 4.

       " 'Problem. The numbers from 1 to 1000000 can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number from 1 to 1000000 and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Initially all of the numbers are black. Is it possible to make a sequence of moves after which all of the numbers are colored white?  \\n\\n(1999 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. It is possible. We begin by proving the following lemma:  \\n\\nLemma. Given a set $S$ of positive integers, there is a subset $T\\\\subseteq S$ such that every element of $S$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ .  \\n\\nProof. We prove the claim by induction on $|S|$ , the number of elements in $S$ . If $|S|=1$ then let $T=S$ .  \\n\\nIf $|S|>1$ , then let $\\\\alpha$ be the smallest element of $S$ . Consider the set $S^{\\\\prime}=S\\\\backslash\\\\{a\\\\}$ , the set of the largest $|S|-1$ elements in $S$ . By induction there is a subset $T^{\\\\prime}\\\\subseteq S^{\\\\prime}$ such that every element in $S^{\\\\prime}$ divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\\\prime}$ .  \\n\\nIf $a$ also divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\\\prime}$ , then the set $T=T^{\\\\prime}$ suffices. Otherwise, consider the set ${\\\\cal T}={\\\\cal T}^{\\\\prime}\\\\cup\\\\{a\\\\}$ . $a$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ . Every other element in $T$ is bigger than $a$ and can’t divide it, but divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\\\prime}=T\\\\backslash\\\\{a\\\\}$ . Hence $T$ suffices, completing the induction and the proof of the lemma. □  \\n\\nNow, write each number $n>1$ in its prime factorization  \\n\\n$$\\nn=p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot p_{k}^{a_{k}},\\n$$  \\n\\nwhere the $p_{i}$ are distinct primes and the $a_{i}$ ate positive integers. Notice that the color of $n$ will always be the same as the color of $P(n)=p_{1}p_{2}\\\\ldots p_{k}$ .  \\n\\nApply the lemma to the set $S$ consisting in all $P(i)$ for $\\\\begin{array}{r l}{i}&{{}=}\\\\end{array}$ $2,3,\\\\ldots,1000000$ to find a subset $T\\\\subset S$ such that every element of $S$  \\n\\ndivides an odd number of elements in $T$ . For each $q\\\\in S$ , let $t(q)$ equal the   \\nnumber of elements in $T$ that divides, and let $u(q)$ equal the number of $q$   \\nprimes dividing $q$ .  \\n\\nSelect all the numbers in $T$ , and consider how the color of a number $n>1$ changes. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of elements in $T$ not relatively prime to $n$ equals  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{q|P(n),q>1}(-1)^{u(q)+1}t(q).\\n$$  \\n\\nIn particular, if $q|P(n)$ is divisible by exactly $m>0$ primes, then it is counted ${\\\\binom{m}{1}}-{\\\\binom{m}{2}}+{\\\\binom{m}{3}}-\\\\cdots=1$ time in the sum. (For example, if $n\\\\ =\\\\ 6$ then the number of elements in $T$ divisible by 2 or 3 equals $t(2)+t(3)-t(6)$ .)  \\n\\nBy the definition of $T$ , each of the values $t(q)$ is odd. Because there are $2^{k}-1$ divisors $q>1$ of $P(n)$ , the above quantity is the sum of $2^{k}-1$ odd numbers and is odd itself. Therefore after selecting $T$ , every number $n>1$ will switch color an odd number of times and will turn white.  \\n\\nFinally, select 1 to turn 1 white to complete the process.  \\n\\nNote. In fact, a slight modification of the above proof shows that $T$ is unique. With some work, this stronger result implies that there is in essence exactly one way to make all the numbers white up to trivial manipulations.  \\n\\nSecond solution. Yes, it is possible. We prove a more general statement, where we replace 1000000 in the problem by some arbitrary positive integer $m$ . We also focus on the numbers divisible by just a few primes instead of all the primes.  \\n\\nLemma. For a finite set of distinct primes $S~=~\\\\{p1,p_{2},...,p_{n}\\\\}$ , let $Q_{m}(S)$ be the set of numbers between $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{Z}}$ and $m$ divisible only by primes in $S$ . The elements of $Q_{m}(S)$ can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number in $Q_{m}(S)$ and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Then it is possible to reverse the coloring of $Q_{m}(S)$ by selecting several numbers in a subset $R_{m}(S)\\\\subseteq Q_{m}(S)$ .  \\n\\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction on $n$ . If $n=1$ , then selecting $p_{1}$ suffices. Now suppose $n>1$ , and assume without loss of generality that the numbers are all black to start with.  \\n\\nLet $T=\\\\{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n-1}\\\\}$ , and define $t$ to be the largest integer such that $t p_{n}\\\\leq m$ . We can assume $t\\\\geq1$ because otherwise we could ignore $p_{n}$ and just use the smaller set $T$ , and we’d be done by our induction hypothesis.  \\n\\nNow select the numbers in $R_{m}(T),R_{t}(T)$ , and $p_{n}R_{t}(T)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\{p_{n}x|\\\\ x\\\\ \\\\in$ $R_{t}(T)\\\\}$ , and consider the effect of this action on a number $y$ :  \\n\\n$y$ is not a multiple of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. If selecting $x\\\\in R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color, selecting $x p_{n}$ will change it back so that $y$ will become white.   \\n$y$ is a power of $p_{n}$ .

Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. Because $y\\\\neq p_{n}^{i}$ , it is divisible by some prime in $T$ so selecting the numbers in $R_{t}(T)$ makes $y$ black again. Finally, each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.  \\n\\nTherefore, all the multiples of $p_{n}$ are the same color (black if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is even, white if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is odd), while all the other numbers in $Q_{m}(S)$ are white.

Because 3 does not divide 17, 3 cannot divide $y$ either. Hence applying our result from the previous paragraph twice, once with $(a,m)=(y,n)$ and once with $(a,m)=(y+3^{n-1},n)$ , we find that $3^{n+1}$ must divide either $(y+3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ or $(y+2\\\\cdot3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ .  \\n\\nHence there exists a natural number $x^{\\\\prime}$ not divisible by 3 such that $3^{n+1}|{x^{\\\\prime}}^{3}+17$ .

Determine all positive integers which do not divide any wobbly number.  \\n\\n( $35^{t h}$ IMO Shortlist)  \\n\\nSolution. If $n$ is a multiple of 10, then the last digit of any multiple of $n$ is $0$ . Hence it is not wobbly. If $n$ is a multiple of 25, then the last two digits of any multiple of $n$ are 25, 50, 75 or 00. Hence it is not wobbly. We now prove that these are the only numbers not dividing any wobbly number.  \\n\\nWe first consider odd numbers $m$ not divisible by 5. Then $g c d(m,10)=1$ , and we have $g c d((10^{k}-1)m,10)=1$ , for any $k\\\\geq1$ . It follows that there exists a positive integer $\\\\it l$ such that $10^{l}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $(10^{k}-1)m,$ ), and we have $10^{k l}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $(10^{k}-1)m)$ .

In particular, $x_{2}$ is a wobbly multiple of $m$ . If $m$ is divisible by 5, then $5x_{2}$ is a wobbly multiple of $m$ .  \\n\\nNext, we consider powers of 2. We prove by induction on $t$ that $2^{2t+1}$ has a wobbly multiple $w_{t}$ with precisely $t$ non-zero digits. For $t=1$ , take $w_{1}=8$ . Suppose $w_{t}$ exists for some $t\\\\geq1$ . Then $w_{t}=2^{2t+1}d$ for some $d$ . Let $w_{t+1}=$ $10^{2t}c+w_{t}$ where $c\\\\in\\\\{1,2,3,...,9\\\\}$ is to be chosen later. Clearly, $w_{t+1}$ is wobbly, and has precisely $t+1$ non-zero digits. Since $w_{t+1}+2^{2t}(5^{2t}c+2d)$ , it is divisible by $2^{2t+3}$ if and only if $5^{2t}c+2d\\\\equiv0$ (mod 8) or $c\\\\equiv6d$ (mod 8). We can always choose $c$ to be one of 8, $6$ , 4 and 2 in order to satisfy this congruence. Thus the inductive argument is completed.

       " 'Problem. What is the smallest multiple of 99 whose digits sum to 99 and which begins and ends with 97?  \\n\\n(1997 Rio Platense Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. We refer to the digits of the number besides the two 97s as interior digits; the sum of these digits is $99-2(9+7)=67$ . Since each digit is at most 9, there are at least 8 such digits.  \\n\\nNote that the sum of digits being 99 forces the number to be divisible by 9; thus it suffices to ensure that the number be divisible by 11, which is to say, the alternating sum of digits must be divisible by 11.  \\n\\nSuppose the number has exactly 8 interior digits. If $a$ is the sum of the odd interior places and $b$ the sum of the even places, we have $a+b=67$ and $a-b\\\\equiv-3$ (mod 11). Since $a-b$ must also be odd, we have $a-b\\\\ge7$ or $a-b\\\\leq-15$ , and so either $a\\\\geq37$ or $b\\\\geq41$ , contradicting the fact that $a$ and $b$ are each the sum of four digits.  \\n\\nNow suppose the number has 9 interior digits. In this case, $a-b\\\\equiv0$ (mod 11), so $a-b\\\\geq11$ or $a-b\\\\leq-11$ . In the latter case, $b\\\\geq39$ , again a contradiction, but in the former case, we have $a\\\\geq39$ , which is possible because $a$ is now the sum of five digits. To minimize the original number, we take the odd digits to be 3, 9, 9, 9, 9 and the even digits to be 1, 9, 9, 9, making the minimal number 9731999999997.  \\n\\n',\n",

When $n=8$ , the sum of the digits of $f(8)=201$ is 3. Suppose that there was some $m$ such that $f(m)$ had a smaller sum of digits. Then the last digit of $f(m)$ must be either $0$ , $^{1}$ , or 2.

Exactly in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 1.7.1 one can prove that any two $d$ -digit numbers which have only ones and twos give different residues mod $2^{d}$ .

For $k=1$ , $n=1$ has the desired property. For $k=2$ , $n=12$ has the desired property. Now, for each $k>2$ we have some number $d$ satisfying the condition Lemma 2. Consider a $k$ -digit integer $n$ such that the last $d$ digits of $n$ have the property described in the first Lemma. We can choose each of the other digits of $n$ to be any number between zero and nine. We know that the sum of the last $d$ digits of $n$ is between $d$ and $2d$ , and we can choose the sum of the other $k-d$ digits to be any number between $k-d$ and $9(k-d)$ . Since $k-d+2d\\\\leq2^{d}\\\\leq9(k-d)+d$ , we can choose the other digits such that the sum of the digits of $n$ is $2^{d}$ . This completes the proof because $n$ is a multiple of $2^{d}$ .  \\n\\nRemark. A number divisible by the sum of its digits is called a Niven1 number.

We will prove by induction that $2^{n+1}$ appears in exactly $n$ Pythagorean triples. The base case $n=1$ holds for $(3,2^{2},5)$ is the only such triple. Assume that $(x_{k},y_{k},z_{k})$ , where $x_{k}=u_{k}^{2}-v_{k}^{2}$ , $y_{k}=2u_{k}v_{k}$ , $z_{k}=$ $u_{k}^{2}+v_{k}^{2}$ , $k=1,\\\\dots,n$ are the $n$ triples containing $2^{n+1}$ .

Indeed, if $(u^{2}-v^{2},2u v,u^{2}+v^{2})$ were a triple containing $2^{n+2}$ , then we would have the following cases:  \\n\\ni) $u^{2}+v^{2}=2^{n+2}$ .

Of course, there is $1\\\\leq i\\\\leq12$ such that $d_{i}=d_{1}+d_{2}+d_{4}$ . Since $d_{i}>d_{4}$ , we have $i\\\\geq5$ . Also, observe that $d_{j}d_{13-j}=m$ for all $j$ and since $d_{i}d_{8}=d_{d_{4}-1}\\\\leq n$ , we must have $i\\\\leq5$ , thus $i=5$ and $d_{1}+d_{2}+d_{4}=d_{5}$ . Also, $d_{d_{4}-1}=d_{5}d_{8}=n=d_{12}$ , thus $d_{4}=13$ and $d_{5}=14+d_{2}$ . Of course, $d_{2}$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$ and since $d_{4}=13$ , we can only have $d_{2}\\\\in\\\\{2,3,5,7,11\\\\}$ . Also, since $n$ has 12 divisors, it has at most 3 prime divisors.

We will call a number ”good” if it satisfies the given conditions. It is not difficult to see that all prime powers are good. Suppose $n$ is a good number that has at least two distinct prime factors. Let $n=p^{r}s$ , where $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $n$ and $s$ is not divisible by $p$ . Because $n$ is good, $p+s-1$ must divide $n$ . For any prime $q$ dividing $s$ , $s<p+s-1<s+q$ , so $q$ does not divide $p+s-1$ . Therefore, the only prime factor of $p+s-1$ is $p$ . Then $s=p^{c}-p+1$ for some $c>1$ . Because $p^{c}$ must also divide $n$ , $p^{c}+s-1=2p^{c}-p$ divides $n$ . Because $2p^{c-1}-1$ has no factors of $p$ , it must divide $s$ . But a simple computation shows that $\\\\frac{p-1}{2}<\\\\frac{p^{c}-p+1}{2p^{c-1}-1}<\\\\frac{p+1}{2}$ , therefore $2p^{c-1}-1$ cannot divide $s$ .  \\n\\n',\n",

At least one of six consecutive numbers is divisible by 5. From the given condition it follows that two numbers must be divisible by 5. These two numbers are necessarily $n$ and $n+5$ . Therefore $n$ and $n+5$ are in distinct subsets. Since $n(n+1)>n+5$ , it follows that a required partition cannot be considered with subsets of different cardinality.

Note that $3\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot7\\\\cdot19=1995$ . If the chosen divisors include one divisible by 19 and another not divisible by 19, the quotient of the two has numerator divisible by 19, solving the problem since $n\\\\leq16$ . If this is not the case, either all divisors are or divisible by 19 or none of them has this property, and in particular $n\\\\leq8$ . Without loss of generality, assume the divisors are all not divisible by 19.  \\n\\nUnder this assumption, we are done if the divisors include one divisible by 7 and another not divisible by 7, unless $n=8$ . In the latter case all of the divisors not divisible by 19 occur, including 1 and $3\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot7$ , so this case also follows.

Is it possible to place 1995 different natural numbers along a circle so that for any two these numbers, the ratio of the greatest to the least is a prime?  \\n\\n(1995 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. No, this is impossible. Let $a_{0},\\\\dotsc,a_{1995}=a_{0}$ be the integers. Then for $i=1,\\\\ldots,1995$ , $a_{k-1}/a_{k}$ is either a prime or the reciprocal of a prime; suppose the former occurs $m$ times and the latter $1995-m$ times. The product of all of these ratios is $a_{0}/a_{1995}=1$ , but this means that the product of some $m$ primes equals the product of some $1995-m$ primes. This can only occurs when the primes are the same (by unique factorization), and in particular there have to be the same number on both sides. But $m=1995-m$ is impossible since 1995 is odd, contradiction.  \\n\\n',\n",

By AM-GM inequality,  \\n\\n$$\\na b\\\\leq{\\\\frac{(a+b)^{2}}{4}}=(p+1)^{2}.\\n$$  \\n\\nSince $a b=p^{2}+p+n$ , it follows that: $p^{2}+p+n\\\\leq(p+1)^{2}$ . From the last inequality, $p\\\\ge n-1$ and this contradicts the choice of $p$ . The conclusion is $a\\\\geq p+1$ .  \\n\\nSince $n<3p^{2}$ , $p^{2}+p+n<4p^{2}+p<(2p+1)^{2}$ . Taking in account that $p^{2}+p+n=a b$ , we have $a b<(2p+1)^{2}$ and thus, $a<2p+1$ .  \\n\\nWe may repeat the previous argument: $0\\\\leq a-p-1<p$ and then $(a-p-1)^{2}+(a-p-1)+n$ is prime a number. A standard computation gives:  \\n\\n$$\\n(a-p-1)^{2}+(a-p-1)+n=p^{2}+p+n+a(a-2p-1)=a(b+a-2p-1).\\n$$  \\n\\nWe obtain, again $b+a=2p+2=2(p+1)$ .  \\n\\nOn the other hand:  \\n\\n$$\\na+b\\\\geq2{\\\\sqrt{a b}}=2{\\\\sqrt{p^{2}+p+n}}>2{\\\\sqrt{p^{2}+p+p+1}}=2(p+1).\\n$$  \\n\\nThus, we obtain a contradiction, so our initial assumption was incorrect.  \\n\\nRemark.

For $37\\\\leq n<41$ , let $k=a b=n!/1998$ . Since $g c d(a,b)=1$ , any prime factor of $k$ that occurs in $a$ cannot occur in $b$ , and vice-versa. There are 11 prime factors of $k$ , namely 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31. For each of those prime factors, one must decide only whether it occurs in $a$ or in $b$ . These 11 decisions can be made in a total of $2^{11}=2048$ ways. However, only half of these ways will satisfy the condition $a\\\\ <\\\\ b$ . Thus there will be a total of 1024 such pairs of $(x,y)$ for $n=37$ , 38, 39, 40. Since  \\n\\n41 is a prime, we can see by a similar argument that there will be at least   \\n2048 such pairs of $(x,y)$ for $n\\\\geq41$ .  \\n\\n',\n",

Then $d(m_{1}+n_{1})=d^{2}d_{m n}^{2}$ , where $d_{m n}=g c d(m_{1},n_{1})$ , so $m_{1}+n_{1}=d d_{m n}^{2}$ .

As these three numbers are relatively prime, we have $\\\\frac{d}{g c d(d,2)}=1$ and so $d\\\\leq2$ .  \\n\\nNote that $d_{l m},d_{l n},d_{m n}$ are pairwise relatively prime; therefore we can write $l_{1}=l_{2}d_{l m}d_{l n}$ , $m_{1}=m_{2}d_{l m}d_{m n}$ , $n_{1}=n_{2}d_{l n}d_{m n}$ .

If $n$ is composite, say $n=p q$ , we can assemble sets of $p$ integers whose sum is divisible by $p$ as long as at least $2p-1$ numbers remain; this gives $2q-1$ sets, and again by the induction hypothesis, some $q$ of these have sum divisible by $q$ .  \\n\\nNow suppose $n=p$ is prime.

Now, we need to find a sequence $(m_{k})_{k\\\\geq1}$ of multiples of $p$ such that $f_{p}(m_{k})$ are pairwise relatively prime. This is not as easy as in the first example.

The case $r=13$ is also impossible, because $2003^{q}+1\\\\equiv2$ (mod 13) and $r|2003^{q}+1$ . So, we have found that for any prime factor $r$ of $p^{2}+1$ , we have either $r=2$ or $q|o_{r}(2003)$ , which in turn implies $q|r-1$ . Because $p^{2}+1$ is even, but not divisible by 4 and because any odd prime factor of it is congruent to 1 modulo $q$ , we must have $p^{2}+1\\\\equiv2$ (mod $q$ ).

It is quite clear that $p,q,r$ are distinct. Indeed, if for example $p=q$ , then the relation $p|q^{r}+1$ is impossible. We will prove that we cannot have $p,q,r>2$ . Suppose this is the case. The first condition $p|q^{r}+1$ implies $p|q^{2r}-1$ and so $o_{p}(q)|2r$ . If $o_{p}(q)$ is odd, it follows that $p|q^{r}-1$ , which combined with $p|q^{r}+1$ yields $p=2$ , which is impossible. Thus, $o_{p}(q)$ is either 2 or $2r$ . Could we have $o_{p}(q)=2r$ ? No, since this would imply that $2r|p-1$ and so $0\\\\equiv p^{q}+1$ ( $\\\\mod r)\\\\equiv2$ (mod $r$ ), that is $r\\\\ =\\\\ 2$ , false.

In the same way, we find that $q|\\\\frac{r+1}{2}$ and r p + 1 . $r|\\\\frac{p+1}{2}$ This is clearly impossible, just by looking at the largest among $p,q,r$ . So, our assumption was wrong and indeed one of the three primes must equal 2. Suppose without loss of generality that $p=2$ . Then $q$ is odd, $q|r^{2}+1$ and $r|2^{q}+1$ . Similarly, $o_{r}(2)|2q$ . If $q|o_{r}(2)$ , then $q|r-1$ and so $q|r^{2}+1-(r^{2}-1)=2$ , which contradicts the already established result that $q$ is odd. Thus, $o_{r}(2)|2$ and $r|3$ . As a matter of fact, this implies that $r=3$ and $q=5$ , yielding the triple (2,5,3). It is immediate to verify that this triple satisfies all conditions of the problem.

Without loss of generality assume $p\\\\leq q$ ; the unique solution will be (11,17), for which one may check the congruence using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We first have $2^{3p q}\\\\equiv2$ (mod 3), which means $p$ and $q$ are odd. In addition, if $\\\\alpha$ is a primitive root mod $p$ , then $\\\\alpha^{3p q-1}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ) implies that $p-1$ divides $3p q-1$ as well as $3p q-1-3q(p-1)=$ $3q-1$ , and conversely that $q-1$ divides $3p-1$ . If $p=q$ , we now deduce $p=q=3$ , but $4^{27}\\\\equiv1$ (mod 27), so this fails. Hence $p<q$ .  \\n\\nSince $p$ and $q$ are odd primes, $q\\\\geq p+2$ , so $(3p-1)/(q-1)<3$ .

It suffices to take 25 such numbers. To each number, associate the triple $(x_{2},x_{3},x_{5})$ recording the parity of the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 is its prime factorization. Two numbers have the same triple if and only if their product is a perfect square.

Find all collections of 100 positive integers such that the sum of the fourth powers of every four of the integers is divisible by the product of the four numbers.  \\n\\n(1997 St. Petersburg City Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. Such sets must be $n,n,\\\\ldots,n$ or $\\\\ 3n,n,n,\\\\ldots,n$ for some integer $n$ . Without loss of generality, we assume the numbers do not have a common factor. If $u,v,w,x,y$ are five of the numbers, then $u v w$ divides $u^{4}+v^{4}+$ $w^{4}+x^{4}$ and $u^{4}+v^{4}+w^{4}+y^{4}$ , and so divides $x^{4}-y^{4}$ . Likewise, $v^{4}\\\\equiv$ $w^{4}\\\\equiv x^{4}$ (mod $u$ ), and from above, $3v^{4}\\\\equiv0$ (mod $u$ ). If $u$ has a prime divisor not equal to 3, we conclude that every other integer is divisible by the same prime, contrary to assumption. Likewise, if $u$ is divisible by 9, then every other integer is divisible by 3. Thus all of the numbers equal $1$ or 3.

Observe then that if $x,y$ are on the same column, then $x|y$ or $y|x$ . Now, look at the first 2002 lines. We find in this $2002\\\\times2001$ matrix at least 2002 terms of the sequence (at least one on each line), thus there are two terms of the sequence on the same column and one will divide the other.  \\n\\n',\n",

For each $n$ , let $\\\\operatorname{rad}(n)$ denote the largest square-free divisor of $n$ (i.e. the product of all distinct prime factors of $n$ ). We let $b_{n}$ equal to the ratio of the following two numbers:  \\n\\n$E_{n}$ , the product of all $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$ such that $d$ is square-free, divides $n$ , and has an even number of prime factors.   \\n$O_{n}$ , the product of all $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$ such that $d$ is square-free, divides $n$ , and has an odd number of prime factors.  \\n\\nLemma 1. $\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid a_{n}}b_{d}=a_{n}.$  \\n\\nProof. Fix $n$ , and observe that $\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}b_{n}$ equals  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}E_{d}}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}O_{d}}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nIn the numerator of $(*)$ , each $E_{d}$ is the product of $a_{m}$ such that $m|d$ . Also, $d|n$ , implying that the numerator is the product of various $a_{m}$ such that $m|n$ . For fixed $m$ that divides $n$ , how many times does $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator $\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}E_{d}$ of (∗)?  \\n\\nIf $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ and $d|n$ , then let $t=d/m$ . By the definition of $E_{d}$ , we know that (i) $t$ is square-free and (ii) $t$ has an even number of prime factors. Because $d|n$ and $t=d/m$ , we further know that (iii) $t$ divides $n/m$ .  \\n\\nConversely, suppose that $t$ is any positive integer satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), and write $d=t m$ . By (iii), $d$ is a divisor of $n$ . Also, $t$ is square-free by (i), is a divisor of $d$ , and has an even number of prime factors by (ii). Thus, $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ .  \\n\\nSuppose that $n/m$ has $\\\\it l$ distinct prime factors. Then it has ${\\\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\\\binom{l}{2}}+$ . factors $t$ satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), implying that $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator of $(*)$ exactly  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\\\binom{l}{2}}+\\\\dots\\n$$  \\n\\ntimes.

Of all the integers $n$ such that $\\\\alpha|a_{n}$ , let $d$ be the smallest.  \\n\\nIf $\\\\alpha|a_{n}$ , then $\\\\alpha|g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}$ . By the minimal definition of $d$ , $g c d(d,n)\\\\geq d$ . But $g c d(d,n)|n$ as well, implying that $g c d(d,n)=d$ . Hence, $d|n$ .  \\n\\nIf $d|n$ , then $g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}=a_{d}$ . Thus, $\\\\displaystyle a_{d}|a_{n}$ . Because $\\\\alpha|a_{d}$ , it follows that $\\\\alpha|a_{n}$ as well. □  \\n\\nLemma 3. For each positive integer $n$ , $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer.  \\n\\nProof. Fix $n$ . Call an integer $d$ a top divisor (resp. a bottom divisor) if $d|n,n/d$ is square-free, and $n/d$ has an even (resp. odd) number of prime factors. By definition, $E_{d}$ is the product of $\\\\mathit{a}_{d}$ over all top divisors $d$ , and $O_{d}$ is the product of $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{d}$ over all bottom divisors $d$ .  \\n\\nFix any prime $p$ . We show that $p$ divides $E_{n}$ at least as many times as it divides $O_{n}$ . To do this, it suffices to show the following for any positive integer $k$ :  \\n\\n(1) The number of top divisors $d$ with $\\\\boldsymbol a_{n/d}$ divisible by $p^{k}$ is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ with divisible by $p^{k}$ . $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$  \\n\\nLet $k$ be any positive integer. If $p^{k}$ divides none of $a_{1},a_{2},\\\\dotsc$ , then (1) holds trivially. Otherwise, by the previous lemma, there exists an integer $d_{0}$ such that  \\n\\n$$\\np^{k}|a_{m}\\\\ \\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\ d_{0}|m.\\n$$  \\n\\nHence, to show (1) it suffices to show:  \\n\\n(2) The number of top divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ , is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ .  \\n\\nIf $d_{0}\\\\nmid n$ , then (2) holds because $d_{0}$ does not divide $n/d$ for any divisor $d$ of $n$ , including top or bottom divisors.  \\n\\nOtherwise, $d_{0}|n$ . For which top and bottom divisors $d$ does $d_{0}$ divide $n/d$ ? Precisely those for which $d$ divides $n/d_{0}$ . If $n/d_{0}$ has $l\\\\geq1$ distinct prime factors, then there are as many top divisors with this property as there are bottom divisors, namely  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\\\binom{l}{2}}+\\\\cdots=2^{l-1}={\\\\binom{l}{1}}+{\\\\binom{l}{3}}+\\\\ldots\\n$$  \\n\\nIf instead $d_{0}=n$ and $\\\\mathit{l}\\\\mathit{\\\\Theta}=0$ , then the top divisor 1 is the only value $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ . In either case, there are at least as many top divisors $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ as there are bottom divisors with the same property. Therefore, (2) holds. This completes the proof. □  \\n\\nTherefore, $a_{n}=\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}b_{d}$ , and $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer for each $n$ .  \\n\\nAlternative solution.

The function $f_{i}(a,b)$ is symmetric for any odd $i$ .  \\n\\nProof. We will prove also that $f_{i}(a,b)$ is symmetric function multiplied by $a$ . Now, we are to prove that $f_{2k-1}(a,b)$ is symmetric and $f_{2k-2}(a,b)=$ $a g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ , where $g_{2k-2}$ is symmetric too, for any positive integer $k$ . Proceed by induction on $k$ . For $k=1$ we have $f_{1}(a,b)=1$ and $g_{0}(a,b)=0$ .  \\n\\nSuppose that $f_{2k-1}(a,b)$ is symmetric and $f_{2k-2}(a,b)=a g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ where $g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ is symmetric too.

Proceed by induction on $k$ . For $k=1$ this statement is true. Let $x_{m}|x_{k m}$ . Then from (1) and (2) putting $r=k m$ and $i=m$ , we obtain the following. If $k m$ is even, then  \\n\\n$$\\nx_{m(k+1)}\\\\equiv f_{m}(a,b)x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv x_{m}x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv0{\\\\pmod{x_{m}}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nFor $k m$ odd $m$ is odd too and $f_{m}(a,b)=f_{m}(b,a)$ . Hence, we have  \\n\\n$$\\nx_{m(k+1)}\\\\equiv f_{m}(b,a)x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv f_{m}(a,b)x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv x_{m}x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv0{\\\\pmod{x_{m}}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nSo, for each nonnegative integers $k,m\\\\ x_{m}|x_{k m}$ .  \\n\\nSince the product $x_{n+1}x_{n+2}\\\\ldots x_{n+m}$ has $m$ terms, one of their indices is divisible by $m$ and another’s index is divisible by $m-1$ . Thus both $x_{m}$ and $x_{m-1}$ divide the product. If we can show that $x_{m}$ is relatively prime to $x_{m-1}$ , we would be done. We will prove this by induction. For the base case, $x_{0}$ is relatively prime to $x_{1}$ . Now, $x_{2n}=a x_{2n-1}-x_{2n-2}$ . Any prime factor common to $x_{2n}$ and $x_{2n-1}$ must also divide $x_{2n-2}$ , but because $x_{2n-2}$ is relatively prime to $x_{2n-1}$ , there is no such prime factor. A similar argument holds for $x_{2n+1}$ because $x_{2n+1}=b x_{2n}-x_{2n-1}$ . Thus $x_{m}x_{m-1}|(x_{n+1}x_{n+2}\\\\dots x_{n+m})$ .  \\n\\n',\n",

We claim this is the set of all possible values of $p$ .  \\n\\nIf some prime $p$ is not in $T$ , then look at the set $S=T$ . Then there must be some prime $q\\\\not\\\\in S$ less than 10000 such that  \\n\\n$$\\n(q+1)|(M_{2}+1)(M_{3}+1)(M_{5}+1)(M_{7}+1)(M_{13}+1)=2^{30}.\\n$$  \\n\\nThus, $q+1$ is a power of 2 and $q$ is a Mersenne prime less than 10000, and therefore $q\\\\in T=S$ , a contradiction.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, suppose $p$ is in $T$ . Suppose we have a set $S\\\\ =$ $\\\\{p_{1},p_{2},\\\\dotsc,p_{k}\\\\}\\\\subseteq P^{*}$ not including $p$ , with $k\\\\geq2$ and $p_{1}<p_{2}<\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot<$ $p_{k}$ . Suppose, by way of contradiction, that for all $q\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}^{*}$ such that $(q+1)|(p_{1}+1)\\\\dots(p_{k}+1)$ , we have $q\\\\in S$ . Then  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\\\mathrm{4}|(p_{1}+1)(p_{2}+1)\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ M_{2}\\\\in S}\\\\\\\\ &{}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\mathrm{8}|(M_{2}+1)(p_{2}+1)\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ M_{3}\\\\in S}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\mathrm{32}|(M_{2}+1)(M_{3}+1)\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ M_{5}\\\\in S}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\mathrm{128}|(M_{2}+1)(M_{5}+1)\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ M_{7}\\\\in S}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\mathrm{8192}|(M_{3}+1)(M_{5}+1)(M_{7}+1)\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ M_{13}\\\\in S.}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nThen $p$ , a Mersenne prime under 10000, must be in $S$ , a contradiction. Therefore there is some prime $q<10000$ not in $S$ with $q+1|(p_{1}+1)\\\\dots(p_{k}+$ 1), as desired. This completes the proof.  \\n',\n",

So we need only show that $n\\not=p q$ , $n\\ \\ne\\ p q r$ for primes $p<q<r$ .  \n\nFirst assume $n=p q$ , so $(p-1)(q-1)|p q-1$ .

Now, let us take a prime $p$ and let us apply Legendre’s formula formula as well as the first observations. We find that  \n\n$$\nv_{p}((3a+3b)!(2a)!(3b)!(2b)!)=\\sum_{k\\geq1}\\left(\\left\\lfloor{\\frac{3a+3b}{p^{k}}}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor{\\frac{2a}{p^{k}}}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor{\\frac{3b}{p^{k}}}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor{\\frac{2b}{p^{k}}}\\right\\rfloor\\right)\n$$  \n\nand also  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\displaystyle v_{p}((2a+3b)!(a+2b)!(a+b)!a!(b!)^{2})}}\\\\ {{=\\displaystyle\\sum_{k\\geq1}\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\frac{2a+3b}{p^{k}}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a+2b}{p^{k}}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a+b}{p^{k}}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a}{p^{k}}\\right\\rfloor+2\\left\\lfloor\\frac{b}{p^{k}}\\right\\rfloor\\right)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nOf course, it is enough to prove that for each $k\\geq1$ the term corresponding to $k$ in the first sum is greater than or equal to the term corresponding to $k$ in the second sum. With the substitution $x={\\frac{a}{p^{k}}},y={\\frac{b}{p^{k}}}$ k , we have to prove that for any nonnegative real numbers $x,y$ we have  \n\n$$\n+\\lfloor2y\\rfloor\\geq\\lfloor2x+3y\\rfloor+\\lfloor x+2y\\rfloor+\\lfloor x+y\\rfloor+\\lfloor x\\rfloor+2{\\left\\lfloor y\\right.}\n$$  \n\nThis isn’t easy, but with another useful idea the inequality will become easy. The idea is that  \n\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor3x+3y\\right\\rfloor=3\\lfloor x\\rfloor+3\\lfloor y\\rfloor+\\lfloor3\\{x\\}+3\\{y\\}\\rfloor\n$$  \n\nand similar relations for the other terms of the inequality. After this operation, we see that it suffices to prove the inequality only for $0\\leq x,y<1$ . Because we can easily compute all terms, after splitting in some cases, so that to see when $\\left\\lfloor2\\{x\\}\\right\\rfloor,\\left\\lfloor3\\{y\\}\\right\\rfloor,\\left\\lfloor2\\{y\\}\\right\\rfloor$ are $0$ , 1 or 2.  \n\n"

This time the second formula for $e_{p}(n)$ is useful. Of course, there is no reasonable estimation of this constant, so we should better see what happens if $a!\\cdot b!|n!$ . Then $e_{2}(a)+e_{2}(b)\\leq e_{2}(n!)$ , which can be translated as $a-S_{2}(a)+b-S_{2}(b)\\leq n-S_{2}(n)<n$ . So, we have found almost exactly what we needed: $a+b<n+S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ . Now, we need another observation: the sum of digits of a number $A$ when written in binary is at most the number of digits of $A$ in base 2, which is $1+\\left\\lfloor\\log_{2}A\\right\\rfloor$ (this follows from the fact that $2^{k-1}\\leq A<2^{k}$ , where $k$ is the number of digits of $A$ in base 2).

Again this implies $e_{2}(n_{k})=e_{5}(n_{k})$ and we have seen that this gives no solution. So, actually $x=0$ .

Taking account that $[\\sqrt{280}]=16$ , we may state that the composite numbers in $S\\setminus M$ are precisely the elements of the set  \n\n$$\nC=\\{11^{2};11\\cdot13;11\\cdot17;11\\cdot19;11\\cdot23;13^{2};13\\cdot17;13\\cdot19\\}.\n$$  \n\nObserve that $|C|=8$ . Thus, the set $S\\setminus M$ contains 1, 8 composite numbers are 55 prime numbers. Also, taking in account the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7 we infer that the set $S$ contains 59 prime numbers in all.  \n\nLet $p_{1}=2$ , $p_{2}=3$ , $p_{3}=5,...,p_{59}$ be all these prime numbers and let denote $P=\\{1,p_{2},p_{2},...,p_{59}\\}$ . Thus, $|P|=60$ .  \n\nLet $T$ be a subset containing 217 elements of $S$ . If $|T\\cap P|\\geq5$ it follows that $T$ contains 5 elements which are relatively prime numbers. So, let suppose $|T\\cap P|\\leq4$ . In this case, $|T\\cap(S\\setminus P)|\\geq217-4=213$ . Since $S$ contains 220 composite numbers, it follows that at most 7 composite numbers are not in $T$ .  \n\nConsider the following five-element subsets of $S\\setminus P$ :  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{A_{1}={\\{2^{\\cdot},3^{\\prime},5^{\\prime},7^{\\prime},13^{2}\\}}}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{A_{2}={\\{2^{\\cdot}233^{\\cdot3}195:17:713\\}}\\cdot111\\cdot111}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{A_{3}={\\{2^{\\cdot}2933^{\\cdot3}235:19:717:11\\cdot13\\}}}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{A_{4}={\\{2^{\\cdot}315.3^{\\cdot2}95:23:7\\cdot195:11\\cdot171}}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{A_{5}={\\{2^{\\cdot},37;3\\cdot315:7\\cdot295:723:11\\cdot19\\}}}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{A_{6}={\\{2^{\\cdot}413^{\\cdot3}\\cdot375:317:793:11\\cdot23\\}}}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{A_{7}={\\{2^{\\cdot}433^{\\cdot3}415:37:723:13\\cdot17\\}}}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{A_{8}={\\{2^{\\cdot}47;3\\cdot33;5\\cdot417:3\\cdot12\\cdot19\\}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBy the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists a set $A_{i}$ , $1\\leq i\\leq8$ , such that $A_{i}\\subset T$ ; if not, the set $S\\backslash T$ would contain 8 composite numbers.

         "Problem. The numbers from 1 to 1000000 can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number from 1 to 1000000 and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Initially all of the numbers are black. Is it possible to make a sequence of moves after which all of the numbers are colored white?  \n\n(1999 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \n\nSolution. It is possible. We begin by proving the following lemma:  \n\nLemma. Given a set $S$ of positive integers, there is a subset $T\\subseteq S$ such that every element of $S$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ .  \n\nProof. We prove the claim by induction on $|S|$ , the number of elements in $S$ . If $|S|=1$ then let $T=S$ .  \n\nIf $|S|>1$ , then let $\\alpha$ be the smallest element of $S$ . Consider the set $S^{\\prime}=S\\backslash\\{a\\}$ , the set of the largest $|S|-1$ elements in $S$ . By induction there is a subset $T^{\\prime}\\subseteq S^{\\prime}$ such that every element in $S^{\\prime}$ divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\prime}$ .  \n\nIf $a$ also divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\prime}$ , then the set $T=T^{\\prime}$ suffices. Otherwise, consider the set ${\\cal T}={\\cal T}^{\\prime}\\cup\\{a\\}$ . $a$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ . Every other element in $T$ is bigger than $a$ and can’t divide it, but divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\prime}=T\\backslash\\{a\\}$ . Hence $T$ suffices, completing the induction and the proof of the lemma. □  \n\nNow, write each number $n>1$ in its prime factorization  \n\n$$\nn=p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot p_{k}^{a_{k}},\n$$  \n\nwhere the $p_{i}$ are distinct primes and the $a_{i}$ ate positive integers. Notice that the color of $n$ will always be the same as the color of $P(n)=p_{1}p_{2}\\ldots p_{k}$ .  \n\nApply the lemma to the set $S$ consisting in all $P(i)$ for $\\begin{array}{r l}{i}&{{}=}\\end{array}$ $2,3,\\ldots,1000000$ to find a subset $T\\subset S$ such that every element of $S$  \n\ndivides an odd number of elements in $T$ . For each $q\\in S$ , let $t(q)$ equal the   \nnumber of elements in $T$ that divides, and let $u(q)$ equal the number of $q$   \nprimes dividing $q$ .  \n\nSelect all the numbers in $T$ , and consider how the color of a number $n>1$ changes. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of elements in $T$ not relatively prime to $n$ equals  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{q|P(n),q>1}(-1)^{u(q)+1}t(q).\n$$  \n\nIn particular, if $q|P(n)$ is divisible by exactly $m>0$ primes, then it is counted ${\\binom{m}{1}}-{\\binom{m}{2}}+{\\binom{m}{3}}-\\cdots=1$ time in the sum. (For example, if $n\\ =\\ 6$ then the number of elements in $T$ divisible by 2 or 3 equals $t(2)+t(3)-t(6)$ .)  \n\nBy the definition of $T$ , each of the values $t(q)$ is odd. Because there are $2^{k}-1$ divisors $q>1$ of $P(n)$ , the above quantity is the sum of $2^{k}-1$ odd numbers and is odd itself. Therefore after selecting $T$ , every number $n>1$ will switch color an odd number of times and will turn white.  \n\nFinally, select 1 to turn 1 white to complete the process.  \n\nNote. In fact, a slight modification of the above proof shows that $T$ is unique. With some work, this stronger result implies that there is in essence exactly one way to make all the numbers white up to trivial manipulations.  \n\nSecond solution. Yes, it is possible. We prove a more general statement, where we replace 1000000 in the problem by some arbitrary positive integer $m$ . We also focus on the numbers divisible by just a few primes instead of all the primes.  \n\nLemma. For a finite set of distinct primes $S~=~\\{p1,p_{2},...,p_{n}\\}$ , let $Q_{m}(S)$ be the set of numbers between $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ and $m$ divisible only by primes in $S$ . The elements of $Q_{m}(S)$ can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number in $Q_{m}(S)$ and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Then it is possible to reverse the coloring of $Q_{m}(S)$ by selecting several numbers in a subset $R_{m}(S)\\subseteq Q_{m}(S)$ .  \n\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction on $n$ . If $n=1$ , then selecting $p_{1}$ suffices. Now suppose $n>1$ , and assume without loss of generality that the numbers are all black to start with.  \n\nLet $T=\\{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n-1}\\}$ , and define $t$ to be the largest integer such that $t p_{n}\\leq m$ . We can assume $t\\geq1$ because otherwise we could ignore $p_{n}$ and just use the smaller set $T$ , and we’d be done by our induction hypothesis.  \n\nNow select the numbers in $R_{m}(T),R_{t}(T)$ , and $p_{n}R_{t}(T)\\ =\\ \\{p_{n}x|\\ x\\ \\in$ $R_{t}(T)\\}$ , and consider the effect of this action on a number $y$ :  \n\n$y$ is not a multiple of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. If selecting $x\\in R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color, selecting $x p_{n}$ will change it back so that $y$ will become white.   \n$y$ is a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ and $R_{t}(T)$ has no effect on $y$ , but each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.   \n$p_{n}|y$ but $y$ is not a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. Because $y\\neq p_{n}^{i}$ , it is divisible by some prime in $T$ so selecting the numbers in $R_{t}(T)$ makes $y$ black again. Finally, each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.  \n\nTherefore, all the multiples of $p_{n}$ are the same color (black if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is even, white if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is odd), while all the other numbers in $Q_{m}(S)$ are white. If the multiples of $p_{n}$ are still black, we can select $p_{n}$ to make them white, and we are done. $\\boxed{\\begin{array}{r l}\\end{array}}$  \n\nWe now return to the original problem. Set $m=1000000$ , and let $S$ be the set of all primes under 1000000. From the lemma, we can select numbers between 2 and 1000000 so that all the numbers $2,3,\\ldots,1000000$ are white. Finally, complete the process by selecting 1.  \n"

Because 3 does not divide 17, 3 cannot divide $y$ either. Hence applying our result from the previous paragraph twice, once with $(a,m)=(y,n)$ and once with $(a,m)=(y+3^{n-1},n)$ , we find that $3^{n+1}$ must divide either $(y+3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ or $(y+2\\cdot3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ .  \n\nHence there exists a natural number $x^{\\prime}$ not divisible by 3 such that $3^{n+1}|{x^{\\prime}}^{3}+17$ .

Our proof uses the following result.  \n\nLemma. Let $B=\\{b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},...\\}$ , where $b_{n}$ is the number obtained by writing n in base $p-1$ and reading the result in base $p$ . Then  \n\n(a) for every $a\\notin B$ , there exists $d>0$ such that $a-k d\\in B$ for $k=$ $1,2,\\ldots,p-1$ ; and (b) $B$ contains no $p$ -term arithmetic progression.  \n\nProof. Note that $b\\in B$ if and only if the representation of $b$ in base $p$ does not use the digit $p-1$ .  \n\n(a) Since $a\\not\\in B$ , when $a$ is written in base $p$ at least one digit is $p-1$ . Let $d$ be the positive integer whose representation in base $p$ is obtained from that of $a$ by replacing each $p-1$ by $^{1}$ and each digit other than $p-1$ by 0. Then none of the numbers $a-d$ , $a-2d,\\ldots$ , $a-(p-1)d$ has $p-1$ as a digit when written in base $p$ , and the result follows.  \n\n(b) Let $a,a+d,a+2d,\\ldots,a+(p-1)d$ be an arbitrary $p$ -term arithmetic progression of nonnegative integers. Let $\\delta$ be the rightmost nonzero digit when $d$ is written in base $p$ , and let $\\alpha$ be the corresponding digit in the representation of $a$ . Then $\\alpha,\\alpha+\\delta,\\ldots,\\alpha+(p-1)\\delta$ is a complete set of residues modulo $p$ . It follows that at least one of the numbers $a,a{+}d,\\ldots,a{+}$ $(p-1)d$ has $p-1$ as a digit when written in base $p$ . Hence at least one term of the given arithmetic progression does not belong to $B$ . $\\sqcup$  \n\nLet $(a_{n})_{n\\geq0}$ be the sequence defined in the problem. To prove that $a_{n}=$ $b_{n}$ for all $n\\geq0$ , we use mathematical induction. Clearly $a_{0}=b_{0}=0$ . Assume that $a_{k}=b_{k}$ for $0\\leq k\\leq n-1$ , where $n\\geq1$ . Then $a_{n}$ is the smallest integer greater than $b_{n-1}$ such that $\\{b_{0},b_{1},\\dotsc,b_{n-1},a_{n}\\}$ contains no $p$ -term arithmetic progression. By part (i) of the proposition, $a_{n}\\in B$ so $a_{n}\\geq b_{n}$ . By part (ii) of the proposition, the choice of $a_{n}=b_{n}$ does not yield a $p$ -term arithmetic progression with any of the preceding terms. It follows by induction that $a_{n}=b_{n}$ for all $n\\geq0$ .  \n\n"

Show that if $\\\\varphi(n)$ divides $n-1$ and $\\\\psi(n)\\\\leq3$ , then n is prime.  \\n\\n(1998 Korean Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. Note that for prime $p$ , if $p^{2}|n$ then $p|\\\\varphi(n)$ but $p\\\\nmid n\\\\to1$ , contradiction. So we need only show that $n\\\\not=p q$ , $n\\\\ \\\\ne\\\\ p q r$ for primes $p<q<r$ .  \\n\\nFirst assume $n=p q$ , so $(p-1)(q-1)|p q-1$ .

But if $p=3$ , $q=5$ then  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{p q-1}{(p-1)(q-1)}<2;\\n$$  \\n\\nthe left side is decreasing in each variable and always $>1$ so it cannot be an integer, contradiction.  \\n\\nNow let $n=p q r$ .

Then for $r=7$ we have  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{p q r-1}{(p-1)(q-1)(r-1)}<3\\n$$  \\n\\nso the only integer value ever attainable is 2. Note that $(15r-1)/8(r-1)=2$ gives $r=15$ which is not a prime and we have eliminated all cases.  \\n\\nRemarks. 1) The problem is a direct consequence of Problem 1.1.16.  \\n\\n2) A long stonaling conjecture due to Lehmer asserts that if $\\\\varphi(n)|n-1$ , then $n$ is a prime. This has been proved so far for $\\\\psi(n)\\\\leq14$ . The proofs are very long and computational and no further progress has been made on this conjecture.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Show that the equation $\\\\varphi(n)=\\\\tau(n)$ has only the solutions $n=1,3,8,10,18,24,30$ .  \\n\\nSolution. We check directly that the listed integers satisfy the equation and there are no others $\\\\leq30$ with this property. We will prove that for $n\\\\geq31$ , $\\\\varphi(n)>\\\\tau(n)$ . For this we consider the multiplicative function $f(n)={\\\\frac{\\\\varphi(n)}{\\\\tau(n)}}$ . If $n$ is a prime, we have $f(n)={\\\\frac{n-1}{2}}$ , hence $f$ increases on the set of primes.  \\n\\nFor a prime $p$ , define $S_{p}=\\\\{p^{\\\\alpha}|\\\\alpha\\\\geq1\\\\}$ .

Using the fact that $\\\\operatorname*{min}_{p,\\\\alpha}f(p^{\\\\alpha})=f(2)={\\\\frac{1}{2}}$ , it follows that in order to solve the given equation we need to consider the integers $p^{\\\\alpha}$ with $f(p^{\\\\alpha})\\\\leq2$ .

Let $n>6$ be an integer and $a_{1},a_{2},\\\\ldots,a_{k}$ be all positive integers less than $n$ and relatively prime to $n$ . If  \\n\\n$$\\na_{2}-a_{1}=a_{3}-a_{2}=\\\\cdots=a_{k}-a_{k-1}>0,\\n$$  \\n\\nprove that n must be either a prime number or a power of 2.  \\n\\n( $32^{n d}$ IMO)  \\n\\nSolution. It is given that the reduced system of residues modn chosen from the set $\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,n-1\\\\}$ is an arithmetic progression. We write it as an increasing sequence $1=a_{1}<a_{2}<\\\\cdots<a_{k}=n-1$ .  \\n\\nFor a prime number $n$ the reduced system of residues is the sequence $1<2<\\\\cdots<n-1$ and it is an arithmetic progression with ratio 1. If $n=2^{l}$ the reduced system of residues is $1<3<5<\\\\cdots<2^{l}-1$ and it is an arithmetic progression with ratio 2. The problem asks to prove that only these cases can appear.  \\n\\nLet $a_{2}$ be the second member of the progression. Because $a_{2}>1$ is the least positive number relatively prime to $n$ , it is a prime number, say $p$ and $p>3$ . Then, the ratio of the progression is $a_{2}\\\\:-\\\\:a_{1}=p\\\\:-\\\\:1$ and $a_{k}=n-1=1+(k-1)(p-1)$ . We obtain a ”key” formula:  \\n\\n$$\\nn-2=(k-1)(p-1).\\n$$  \\n\\nRemembering the choice of $p$ , $n$ is divisible by 3 and then $n-2\\\\equiv1$ (mod 3). Thus, by the key formula we cannot have $p\\\\equiv1$ (mod 3). Since $p>3$ we have $p\\\\equiv2$ (mod 3). Then $a_{3}=1+2(p-1)\\\\equiv0$ (mod 3) and this contradicts the supposition that $a_{3}$ and $n$ are relatively prime numbers.  \\n']"

When we write  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n}{p}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor+\\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n}{p^{2}}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor+\\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n}{p^{3}}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor+\\\\ldots,\\n$$  \\n\\nwe write in fact $\\\\sum_{k\\\\geq1}\\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n}{p^{k}}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor$ and this sum has clearly a finite number of nonzero terms.

After this operation, we see that it suffices to prove the inequality only for $0\\\\leq x,y<1$ . Because we can easily compute all terms, after splitting in some cases, so that to see when $\\\\left\\\\lfloor2\\\\{x\\\\}\\\\right\\\\rfloor,\\\\left\\\\lfloor3\\\\{y\\\\}\\\\right\\\\rfloor,\\\\left\\\\lfloor2\\\\{y\\\\}\\\\right\\\\rfloor$ are $0$ , 1 or 2.  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

This time the second formula for $e_{p}(n)$ is useful. Of course, there is no reasonable estimation of this constant, so we should better see what happens if $a!\\\\cdot b!|n!$ . Then $e_{2}(a)+e_{2}(b)\\\\leq e_{2}(n!)$ , which can be translated as $a-S_{2}(a)+b-S_{2}(b)\\\\leq n-S_{2}(n)<n$ . So, we have found almost exactly what we needed: $a+b<n+S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ . Now, we need another observation: the sum of digits of a number $A$ when written in binary is at most the number of digits of $A$ in base 2, which is $1+\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\log_{2}A\\\\right\\\\rfloor$ (this follows from the fact that $2^{k-1}\\\\leq A<2^{k}$ , where $k$ is the number of digits of $A$ in base 2).

This implies of course that $\\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n_{k}}{2^{j}}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n_{k}}{5^{j}}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor$ for all $j$ (because we clearly have $\\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n_{k}}{2^{j}}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor>$ $\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{n_{k}}{5^{j}}\\\\rfloor)$ and so $n_{k}\\\\le3$ . A verification by hand shows that there is no solution in this case.  \\n\\nNext, suppose that $y=0$ .

Again this implies $e_{2}(n_{k})=e_{5}(n_{k})$ and we have seen that this gives no solution. So, actually $x=0$ . A crucial observation is that if $n_{k}>n_{k-1}+1$ , then  \\n\\n$$\\n(n_{1}+1)\\\\ldots(n_{k}-1)n_{k}+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+(n_{k-1}+1)\\\\ldots(n_{k}-1)n_{k}+1\\n$$  \\n\\nis again odd and thus we find again that $e_{2}(n_{k})=n\\\\leq e_{5}(n_{k})$ , impossible. So, $n_{k}=n_{k-1}+1$ . But then, taking into account that $n_{k}$ is a power of 5, we deduce that  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\cdot\\\\cdot(n_{k}-1)n_{k}+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+(n_{k-1}+1)\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot(n_{k}-1)n_{k}+\\\\cdot\\n$$  \\n\\nis congruent to 2 modulo 4 and thus $e_{2}(n_{k})=n+1\\\\leq e_{5}(n_{k})+1$ . It follows that $\\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n_{k}}{2}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor\\\\leq1+\\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n_{k}}{5}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor$ and thus $n_{k}\\\\le6$ . Since $n_{k}$ is a power of 5, we find that $n_{k}=5$ , $n_{k-1}=$ and a quick research of all possibilities shows that there are no solutions.  \\n']"

Hence $f$ is generally multiplicative.  \\n\\nThe converse is not true.

A permissible move consists of selecting a number from 1 to 1000000 and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Initially all of the numbers are black. Is it possible to make a sequence of moves after which all of the numbers are colored white?  \\n\\n(1999 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. It is possible. We begin by proving the following lemma:  \\n\\nLemma. Given a set $S$ of positive integers, there is a subset $T\\\\subseteq S$ such that every element of $S$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ .  \\n\\nProof. We prove the claim by induction on $|S|$ , the number of elements in $S$ . If $|S|=1$ then let $T=S$ .  \\n\\nIf $|S|>1$ , then let $\\\\alpha$ be the smallest element of $S$ . Consider the set $S^{\\\\prime}=S\\\\backslash\\\\{a\\\\}$ , the set of the largest $|S|-1$ elements in $S$ . By induction there is a subset $T^{\\\\prime}\\\\subseteq S^{\\\\prime}$ such that every element in $S^{\\\\prime}$ divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\\\prime}$ .  \\n\\nIf $a$ also divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\\\prime}$ , then the set $T=T^{\\\\prime}$ suffices. Otherwise, consider the set ${\\\\cal T}={\\\\cal T}^{\\\\prime}\\\\cup\\\\{a\\\\}$ . $a$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ . Every other element in $T$ is bigger than $a$ and can’t divide it, but divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\\\prime}=T\\\\backslash\\\\{a\\\\}$ . Hence $T$ suffices, completing the induction and the proof of the lemma. □  \\n\\nNow, write each number $n>1$ in its prime factorization  \\n\\n$$\\nn=p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot p_{k}^{a_{k}},\\n$$  \\n\\nwhere the $p_{i}$ are distinct primes and the $a_{i}$ ate positive integers. Notice that the color of $n$ will always be the same as the color of $P(n)=p_{1}p_{2}\\\\ldots p_{k}$ .  \\n\\nApply the lemma to the set $S$ consisting in all $P(i)$ for $\\\\begin{array}{r l}{i}&{{}=}\\\\end{array}$ $2,3,\\\\ldots,1000000$ to find a subset $T\\\\subset S$ such that every element of $S$  \\n\\ndivides an odd number of elements in $T$ . For each $q\\\\in S$ , let $t(q)$ equal the   \\nnumber of elements in $T$ that divides, and let $u(q)$ equal the number of $q$   \\nprimes dividing $q$ .  \\n\\nSelect all the numbers in $T$ , and consider how the color of a number $n>1$ changes. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of elements in $T$ not relatively prime to $n$ equals  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{q|P(n),q>1}(-1)^{u(q)+1}t(q).\\n$$  \\n\\nIn particular, if $q|P(n)$ is divisible by exactly $m>0$ primes, then it is counted ${\\\\binom{m}{1}}-{\\\\binom{m}{2}}+{\\\\binom{m}{3}}-\\\\cdots=1$ time in the sum. (For example, if $n\\\\ =\\\\ 6$ then the number of elements in $T$ divisible by 2 or 3 equals $t(2)+t(3)-t(6)$ .)  \\n\\nBy the definition of $T$ , each of the values $t(q)$ is odd. Because there are $2^{k}-1$ divisors $q>1$ of $P(n)$ , the above quantity is the sum of $2^{k}-1$ odd numbers and is odd itself. Therefore after selecting $T$ , every number $n>1$ will switch color an odd number of times and will turn white.  \\n\\nFinally, select 1 to turn 1 white to complete the process.  \\n\\nNote. In fact, a slight modification of the above proof shows that $T$ is unique. With some work, this stronger result implies that there is in essence exactly one way to make all the numbers white up to trivial manipulations.  \\n\\nSecond solution. Yes, it is possible. We prove a more general statement, where we replace 1000000 in the problem by some arbitrary positive integer $m$ . We also focus on the numbers divisible by just a few primes instead of all the primes.  \\n\\nLemma. For a finite set of distinct primes $S~=~\\\\{p1,p_{2},...,p_{n}\\\\}$ , let $Q_{m}(S)$ be the set of numbers between $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{Z}}$ and $m$ divisible only by primes in $S$ . The elements of $Q_{m}(S)$ can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number in $Q_{m}(S)$ and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Then it is possible to reverse the coloring of $Q_{m}(S)$ by selecting several numbers in a subset $R_{m}(S)\\\\subseteq Q_{m}(S)$ .  \\n\\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction on $n$ . If $n=1$ , then selecting $p_{1}$ suffices. Now suppose $n>1$ , and assume without loss of generality that the numbers are all black to start with.  \\n\\nLet $T=\\\\{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n-1}\\\\}$ , and define $t$ to be the largest integer such that $t p_{n}\\\\leq m$ . We can assume $t\\\\geq1$ because otherwise we could ignore $p_{n}$ and just use the smaller set $T$ , and we’d be done by our induction hypothesis.  \\n\\nNow select the numbers in $R_{m}(T),R_{t}(T)$ , and $p_{n}R_{t}(T)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\{p_{n}x|\\\\ x\\\\ \\\\in$ $R_{t}(T)\\\\}$ , and consider the effect of this action on a number $y$ :  \\n\\n$y$ is not a multiple of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. If selecting $x\\\\in R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color, selecting $x p_{n}$ will change it back so that $y$ will become white.   \\n$y$ is a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ and $R_{t}(T)$ has no effect on $y$ , but each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.   \\n$p_{n}|y$ but $y$ is not a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. Because $y\\\\neq p_{n}^{i}$ , it is divisible by some prime in $T$ so selecting the numbers in $R_{t}(T)$ makes $y$ black again. Finally, each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.  \\n\\nTherefore, all the multiples of $p_{n}$ are the same color (black if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is even, white if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is odd), while all the other numbers in $Q_{m}(S)$ are white. If the multiples of $p_{n}$ are still black, we can select $p_{n}$ to make them white, and we are done. $\\\\boxed{\\\\begin{array}{r l}\\\\end{array}}$  \\n\\nWe now return to the original problem. Set $m=1000000$ , and let $S$ be the set of all primes under 1000000. From the lemma, we can select numbers between 2 and 1000000 so that all the numbers $2,3,\\\\ldots,1000000$ are white. Finally, complete the process by selecting 1.  \\n']"

Prove that for each natural number $n$ , $n\\\\geq2$ , there is a natural number $x$ for which $f(x)$ is divisible by $3^{n}$ but not by 3n+1.  \\n\\n(1999 Japanese Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. We prove the result by induction on $n$ . If $n=2$ , then $x=1$ suffices. Now suppose that the claim is true for $n\\\\geq2$ , that is, there is a natural number $y$ such that $y^{3}+17$ is divisible by $3^{n}$ but not $3^{n+1}$ . We prove that the claim is true for $n+1$ .  \\n\\nSuppose we have integers $a,m$ such that $a$ is not divisible by 3 and $m\\\\geq2$ . Then $a^{2}\\\\equiv1$ (mod 3) and thus $3^{m}a^{2}\\\\equiv3^{m}$ (mod $3^{m+1}$ ). Also, because $m\\\\geq2$ we have $3m-3\\\\geq2m-1\\\\geq m+1$ . Hence  \\n\\n$$\\n(a+3^{m-1})^{3}\\\\equiv a^{3}+3^{m}a^{2}+3^{2m-1}a+3^{3m-3}\\\\equiv a^{3}+3^{m}{\\\\pmod{3^{m+1}}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nBecause $y^{3}+17$ is divisible by $3^{n}$ , it is congruent to either $0$ , $3^{n}$ , or $2\\\\cdot3^{n}$ modulo $3^{n+1}$ . Because 3 does not divide 17, 3 cannot divide $y$ either. Hence applying our result from the previous paragraph twice, once with $(a,m)=(y,n)$ and once with $(a,m)=(y+3^{n-1},n)$ , we find that $3^{n+1}$ must divide either $(y+3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ or $(y+2\\\\cdot3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ .  \\n\\nHence there exists a natural number $x^{\\\\prime}$ not divisible by 3 such that $3^{n+1}|{x^{\\\\prime}}^{3}+17$ . If $3^{n+2}$ does not divide ${x^{\\\\prime}}^{3}+17$ , we are done. Otherwise, we claim the number $x=x^{\\\\prime}+3^{n}$ suffices. Because $x=x^{\\\\prime}+3^{n-1}+3^{n-1}+3^{n-1}$ , the result from previous the paragraphs tells us that $x^{3}\\\\equiv{x^{\\\\prime}}^{3}+3^{n}+$ $3^{n}+3^{n}\\\\equiv x^{\\\\prime3}$ (mod $3^{n+1}$ ). Thus $3^{n+1}|x^{3}+17$ as well. On the other hand, because $x=x^{\\\\prime}+3^{n}$ , we have $x^{3}\\\\equiv{x^{\\\\prime}}^{3}+3^{n+1}\\\\not\\\\equiv{x^{\\\\prime}}^{3}$ (mod $3^{n+2}$ ). It follows that $3^{n+2}$ does not divide $x^{3}+17$ , as desired. This completes the inductive step.  \\n\\n# Proposed problems  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Let $p$ be an odd prime.

Prove that, for all $n$ , $a_{n}$ is the number obtained by writing n in base $p-1$ and reading the result in base $p$ .  \\n\\n(1995 USA Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. Our proof uses the following result.  \\n\\nLemma. Let $B=\\\\{b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},...\\\\}$ , where $b_{n}$ is the number obtained by writing n in base $p-1$ and reading the result in base $p$ . Then  \\n\\n(a) for every $a\\\\notin B$ , there exists $d>0$ such that $a-k d\\\\in B$ for $k=$ $1,2,\\\\ldots,p-1$ ; and (b) $B$ contains no $p$ -term arithmetic progression.  \\n\\nProof. Note that $b\\\\in B$ if and only if the representation of $b$ in base $p$ does not use the digit $p-1$ .  \\n\\n(a) Since $a\\\\not\\\\in B$ , when $a$ is written in base $p$ at least one digit is $p-1$ . Let $d$ be the positive integer whose representation in base $p$ is obtained from that of $a$ by replacing each $p-1$ by $^{1}$ and each digit other than $p-1$ by 0. Then none of the numbers $a-d$ , $a-2d,\\\\ldots$ , $a-(p-1)d$ has $p-1$ as a digit when written in base $p$ , and the result follows.  \\n\\n(b) Let $a,a+d,a+2d,\\\\ldots,a+(p-1)d$ be an arbitrary $p$ -term arithmetic progression of nonnegative integers. Let $\\\\delta$ be the rightmost nonzero digit when $d$ is written in base $p$ , and let $\\\\alpha$ be the corresponding digit in the representation of $a$ . Then $\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha+\\\\delta,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha+(p-1)\\\\delta$ is a complete set of residues modulo $p$ . It follows that at least one of the numbers $a,a{+}d,\\\\ldots,a{+}$ $(p-1)d$ has $p-1$ as a digit when written in base $p$ . Hence at least one term of the given arithmetic progression does not belong to $B$ . $\\\\sqcup$  \\n\\nLet $(a_{n})_{n\\\\geq0}$ be the sequence defined in the problem. To prove that $a_{n}=$ $b_{n}$ for all $n\\\\geq0$ , we use mathematical induction. Clearly $a_{0}=b_{0}=0$ . Assume that $a_{k}=b_{k}$ for $0\\\\leq k\\\\leq n-1$ , where $n\\\\geq1$ . Then $a_{n}$ is the smallest integer greater than $b_{n-1}$ such that $\\\\{b_{0},b_{1},\\\\dotsc,b_{n-1},a_{n}\\\\}$ contains no $p$ -term arithmetic progression. By part (i) of the proposition, $a_{n}\\\\in B$ so $a_{n}\\\\geq b_{n}$ . By part (ii) of the proposition, the choice of $a_{n}=b_{n}$ does not yield a $p$ -term arithmetic progression with any of the preceding terms. It follows by induction that $a_{n}=b_{n}$ for all $n\\\\geq0$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Suppose that $x,y$ and $z$ are natural numbers such that $x y=z^{2}+1$ . Prove that there exist integers $a,b,c$ and $d$ such that $x=a^{2}+b^{2}$ , $y=c^{2}+d^{2}$ , and $z=a c+b d$ .  \\n\\n(Euler’s problem)  \\n\\nSolution. We prove the claim by strong induction on $z$ . For $z=1$ , we have $(x,y)=(1,2)$ or (2,1); in the former (resp. latter) case, we can set $(a,b,c,d)=(1,0,1,1)$ (resp. (0,1,1,1)).  \\n\\nSuppose that the claim is true whenever $z~<~z_{0}$ , and that we wish to prove it for $(x,y,z)=(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ where $x_{0}y_{0}=z_{0}^{2}+1$ . Without loss of generality, assume that $x_{0}\\\\leq y_{0}$ . Consider the triple $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})=(x_{0},x_{0}+$ $y_{0}-2z_{0},z_{0}-x_{0}\\\\big)$ , so that $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})=(x_{1},x_{1}+y_{1}+2z_{1},x_{1}+z_{1})$ .  \\n\\nFirst, using the fact that $x_{0}y_{0}=z_{0}^{2}+1$ , it is easy to check that $(x,y,z)=$ $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ satisfies $x y=z^{2}+1$ .  \\n\\nSecond, we claim that $x_{1},y_{1},z_{1}>0$ . This is obvious for $x_{1}$ . Next, note that $y_{1}=x_{0}+y_{0}-2z_{0}\\\\geq2{\\\\sqrt{x_{0}y_{0}}}-2z_{0}>2z_{0}-2z_{0}=0$ . Finally, because $x_{0}\\\\leq y_{0}$ and $x_{0}y_{0}=z_{0}^{2}+1$ , we have $x_{0}\\\\leq\\\\sqrt{z_{0}^{2}+1}$ , or $x_{0}\\\\le z_{0}$ . However, $x_{0}\\\\neq z_{0}$ , because this would imply that $z_{0}y_{0}=z_{0}^{2}+1$ , but $z_{0}\\\\uparrow(z_{0}^{2}+1)$ when $z_{0}>1$ . Thus, $z_{0}-x_{0}>0$ , or $z_{1}>0$ .  \\n\\nTherefore, $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ is a triple of positive integers $(x,y,z)$ satisfying $x y=z^{2}+1$ and with $z<z_{0}$ . By the induction hypothesis, we can write $x_{1}=a^{2}+b^{2}$ , $y_{1}=c^{2}+d^{2}$ and $z_{1}=a c+b d$ . Then  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{r l}&{(a c+b d)^{2}=z_{1}^{2}=x_{1}y_{1}-1}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\qquad=(a^{2}+b^{2})(c^{2}+d^{2})-1}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\qquad=(a^{2}c^{2}+b^{2}d^{2}+2a b c d)+(a^{2}d^{2}+b^{2}c^{2}-2a b c d)-1}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\qquad=(a c+b d)^{2}(a d-b c)^{2}-1,}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nso that $|a d-b c|=1$ .  \\n\\nNow, note that $x_{0}=x_{1}=a^{2}+b^{2}$ and $y_{0}=x_{1}+y_{1}+2z_{1}=a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+$ $2(a c+b d)=(a+c)^{2}+(b+d)^{2}$ . In other words, $x_{0}={a^{\\\\prime}}^{2}+{b^{\\\\prime}}^{2}$ and $y_{0}={c^{\\\\prime}}^{2}+{d^{\\\\prime}}^{2}$ for $(a^{\\\\prime},b^{\\\\prime},c^{\\\\prime},d^{\\\\prime})=(a,b,a+c,b+d)$ . Then $|a^{\\\\prime}d^{\\\\prime}-b^{\\\\prime}c^{\\\\prime}|=|a d-b c|=1$ , implying (by logic analogous to the reasoning in the previous paragraph) that $z_{0}=a^{\\\\prime}c^{\\\\prime}+b^{\\\\prime}d^{\\\\prime}$ , as desired.

We prove this by induction on the number of digits of $n$ . First, we know that for all one-digit $n$ , $P(n)=n+1$ . Now suppose that $P(n)\\\\leq n+1$ for all $m$ -digit numbers $n$ . Any $(m+1)$ -digit number $n$ is of the form $10s{+t}$ , where $s$ is an $m$ -digit number.

Let $e$ be the highest exponent such that $p^{e}$ divides $b$ , and let $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ be the corresponding highest exponents for $a$ and $c$ , respectively. Because $b^{2}=a c$ , we have $2e\\\\mathrm{~=~}e_{1}+e_{2}$ .

Otherwise, these highest powers are all $e_{1}$ . Therefore, in both cases, the exponent of $p$ on the left side of the desired equation is the same as the exponent of $p$ on the right side. The desired result follows.  \\n\\nApplying the lemma to the given equation $a_{k}^{2}=a_{r}a_{s}$ , we have  \\n\\n$$\\ng c d(a_{r},a_{k})^{2}=g c d(a_{r},a_{s})a_{r}.\\n$$  \\n\\nIt now follows from the given equation that  \\n\\n$$\\na_{g c d(r,k)}^{2}=a_{g c d(r,s)}a_{r}.\\n$$  \\n\\nAssume, for sake of contradiction, that $g c d(r,k)<r$ , so that $a_{g c d(r,k)}<a_{r}$ . Then from the above equation, it follows that $a_{g c d(r,k)}>$ $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{g c d(r,s)}$ , so that $g c d(r,k)~>~g c d(r,s)$ .

If $n$ is a multiple of 10, then the last digit of any multiple of $n$ is $0$ . Hence it is not wobbly. If $n$ is a multiple of 25, then the last two digits of any multiple of $n$ are 25, 50, 75 or 00. Hence it is not wobbly. We now prove that these are the only numbers not dividing any wobbly number.  \\n\\nWe first consider odd numbers $m$ not divisible by 5. Then $g c d(m,10)=1$ , and we have $g c d((10^{k}-1)m,10)=1$ , for any $k\\\\geq1$ . It follows that there exists a positive integer $\\\\it l$ such that $10^{l}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $(10^{k}-1)m,$ ), and we have $10^{k l}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $(10^{k}-1)m)$ . Now  \\n\\n$$\\n10^{k l}-1=(10^{k}-1)(10^{k(l-1)}+10^{k(l-2)}+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+10^{k}-1).\\n$$  \\n\\nHence $x_{k}=10^{k(l-1)}+10^{k(l-2)}+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+10^{k}+1$ is a multiple of $m$ for any $k\\\\geq1$ . In particular, $x_{2}$ is a wobbly multiple of $m$ . If $m$ is divisible by 5, then $5x_{2}$ is a wobbly multiple of $m$ .  \\n\\nNext, we consider powers of 2. We prove by induction on $t$ that $2^{2t+1}$ has a wobbly multiple $w_{t}$ with precisely $t$ non-zero digits. For $t=1$ , take $w_{1}=8$ . Suppose $w_{t}$ exists for some $t\\\\geq1$ . Then $w_{t}=2^{2t+1}d$ for some $d$ . Let $w_{t+1}=$ $10^{2t}c+w_{t}$ where $c\\\\in\\\\{1,2,3,...,9\\\\}$ is to be chosen later. Clearly, $w_{t+1}$ is wobbly, and has precisely $t+1$ non-zero digits. Since $w_{t+1}+2^{2t}(5^{2t}c+2d)$ , it is divisible by $2^{2t+3}$ if and only if $5^{2t}c+2d\\\\equiv0$ (mod 8) or $c\\\\equiv6d$ (mod 8). We can always choose $c$ to be one of 8, $6$ , 4 and 2 in order to satisfy this congruence. Thus the inductive argument is completed. It now follows that every power of 2 has a wobbly multiple.  \\n\\nFinally, consider numbers of the form $2^{t}m$ , where $t\\\\geq1$ and $g c d(m,10)=$ 1. Such a number has $w_{t}x_{2t}$ as a wobbly multiple.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. A positive integer is called monotonic if its digits in base 10, read from left right, are in nondecreasing order.

Any 1-digit perfect square (namely, 1, 4, or 9) is monotonic, proving the claim for $n=1$ .

If $a$ is the sum of the odd interior places and $b$ the sum of the even places, we have $a+b=67$ and $a-b\\\\equiv-3$ (mod 11). Since $a-b$ must also be odd, we have $a-b\\\\ge7$ or $a-b\\\\leq-15$ , and so either $a\\\\geq37$ or $b\\\\geq41$ , contradicting the fact that $a$ and $b$ are each the sum of four digits.  \\n\\nNow suppose the number has 9 interior digits.

If $d\\\\geq4$ , then $44d\\\\leq44(9)$ has at most 3 digits so that $S(44d)\\\\leq27<8d$ .  \\n\\nNow write $n=\\\\sum n_{i}\\\\cdot10^{i}$ , so that the $n_{i}$ are the digits of $n$ in base $10$ Then  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{c}{{\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum8n_{i}=S(44n)\\\\le\\\\sum S(44n_{i}\\\\cdot10^{i})}}\\\\\\\\ {{\\\\displaystyle\\\\qquad=\\\\sum S(44n_{i})\\\\le\\\\sum8n_{i},}}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nso equality must occur in the second inequality – that is, each of the $n_{i}$ must equal $0,~1$ , or 2. Then each digit of $3n$ is simply three times the corresponding digit of $n$ , and $S(3n)=3S(n)=300$ , as claimed.  \\n\\nAlternative solution. Using properties 3, 5, we have  \\n\\n$$\\nS(3n)\\\\leq3S(n)=300\\n$$  \\n\\nand  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{c}{800=S(11\\\\cdot3n+11n)\\\\leq S(11\\\\cdot3n)+S(11n)}\\\\\\\\ {}\\\\\\\\ {\\\\leq S(11)S(3n)+S(11)S(n)=2S(3n)+200,}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nfrom where $S(3n)\\\\geq300$ . Thus, $S(3n)=300$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Consider all numbers of the form $3n^{2}+n+1$ , where $n$ is a positive integer.  \\n\\n(a) How small can the sum of the digits (in base 10) of such a number be? (b) Can such a number have the sum of its digits (in base 10) equal to 1999?  \\n\\n(1999 United Kingdom Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. (a) Let $f(n)=3n^{2}+n+1$ . When $n=8$ , the sum of the digits of $f(8)=201$ is 3. Suppose that there was some $m$ such that $f(m)$ had a smaller sum of digits. Then the last digit of $f(m)$ must be either $0$ , $^{1}$ , or 2. Because $f(n)\\\\equiv1$ (mod 2) for all $n$ , $f(m)$ must have units digit 1.  \\n\\nBecause $f(n)$ can never equal 1, this means we must have $3m^{2}+m+1=$ $10^{k}+1$ for some positive integer $k$ , and $m(3m+1)=10^{k}$ . Because $m$ and $3m+1$ are relatively prime, and $m<3m+1$ , we must either have $(m,3m+1)=(1,10^{k})$ – which is impossible – or $(m,3m+1)=(2^{k},5^{k})$ . For $k=1$ , $5^{k}\\\\neq3\\\\cdot2^{k}+1$ ; for $k>1$ , we have  \\n\\n$$\\n5^{k}=5^{k-2}\\\\cdot25>2^{k-2}\\\\cdot(12+1)\\\\geq3\\\\cdot2^{k}+1.\\n$$  \\n\\nTherefore, $f(m)$ can’t equal $10^{k}+1$ , and 3 is indeed the minimum value for the sum of digits.  \\n\\n(b) Consider $n=10^{222}-1$ .  \\n\\n$$\\nf(n)=3\\\\cdot10^{444}-6\\\\cdot10^{222}+3+10^{222}.\\n$$  \\n\\nThus, its decimal expansion is  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\underbrace{2\\\\vartheta\\\\ldots\\\\vartheta}_{221}\\\\underbrace{5\\\\vartheta\\\\ldots\\\\vartheta}_{221}3,\\n$$  \\n\\nand the sum of digits in $f(10^{222}-1)$ is 19999.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Consider the set $A$ of all positive integers n with the following properties: the decimal expansion contains no 0, and the sum of the (decimal) digits of $n$ divides $n$ .  \\n\\n(a) Prove that there exist infinitely many elements in A with the following property: the digits that appear in the decimal expansion of A appear the same number of times.  \\n\\n(b) Show that for each positive integer $k$ , there exists an element in A with exactly $k$ digits.  \\n\\n(2001 Austrian-Polish Mathematics Competition)  \\n\\nSolution. (a) We can take $n_{k}=\\\\underbrace{11\\\\ldots1}_{3^{k}t i m e s}$ and prove by induction that $3^{k+2}|10^{3^{k}}-1$ . Alternatively, one can | {sze v}e that ${10}^{3^{k}}-1=(10-1)(10^{2}+10+1)(10^{2\\\\cdot3}+10^{3}+1)\\\\dots(10^{2\\\\cdot3^{k-1}}+10^{3^{k-1}}+1)$ and that $9|10^{-1}$ and $3|10^{2\\\\cdot3^{\\\\iota}}+10^{3^{\\\\iota}}+1$ for $0\\\\leq i\\\\leq k-1$ .  \\n\\n(b) We will need the following lemmas.  \\n\\nLemma 1. For every $d>0$ there exists a $d$ -digit number that contains only ones and twos in its decimal expansion and is a multiple of $2^{d}$ .  \\n\\nProof. Exactly in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 1.7.1 one can prove that any two $d$ -digit numbers which have only ones and twos give different residues mod $2^{d}$ . Since there are $2^{d}$ such numbers, one of them is a multiple of $2^{d}$ . □  \\n\\nLemma 2. For each $k>2$ there exists $d\\\\leq k$ such that the following inequality holds: $k+d\\\\leq2^{d}\\\\leq9k-8d$ .  \\n\\nProof. For $3\\\\le k\\\\le5$ , $d=3$ satisfies the inequalities. For $5\\\\leq k\\\\leq10$ , $d=4$ satisfies the inequalities. We will show that $d=\\\\lfloor\\\\log_{2}4k\\\\rfloor$ satisfies for all $k>10$ . If $k>3$ , then $\\\\log_{2}{4k}\\\\leq2^{k}$ , so $d<k$ . Additionally, $k+d\\\\leq2k\\\\leq$ $2^{d}$ . If $k>10$ , then $16k^{2}\\\\leq2^{k}$ , so $4k\\\\leq2^{k/2}\\\\leq2^{5k/8}$ , $d\\\\leq\\\\log_{2}{4k}\\\\leq\\\\frac{5}{8}n$ n and $8k-8d\\\\geq4k\\\\geq2^{d}$ . $\\\\sqsubset$  \\n\\nNow, return to the original problem. For $k=1$ , $n=1$ has the desired property. For $k=2$ , $n=12$ has the desired property. Now, for each $k>2$ we have some number $d$ satisfying the condition Lemma 2. Consider a $k$ -digit integer $n$ such that the last $d$ digits of $n$ have the property described in the first Lemma. We can choose each of the other digits of $n$ to be any number between zero and nine. We know that the sum of the last $d$ digits of $n$ is between $d$ and $2d$ , and we can choose the sum of the other $k-d$ digits to be any number between $k-d$ and $9(k-d)$ . Since $k-d+2d\\\\leq2^{d}\\\\leq9(k-d)+d$ , we can choose the other digits such that the sum of the digits of $n$ is $2^{d}$ . This completes the proof because $n$ is a multiple of $2^{d}$ .  \\n\\nRemark. A number divisible by the sum of its digits is called a Niven1 number. It has been proved recently that the number of Niven numbers smaller than $x$ is $\\\\left(\\\\frac{14}{27}\\\\log{10}+o(1)\\\\right)\\\\frac{x}{\\\\log{x}}$ x . The courageous reader may try to prove that there are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive numbers which are not Niven numbers (which is easily implied by the above result; yet there is an elementary proof of the last assertion). For more details one can read the article ”Large and small gaps between consecutive Niven numbers”, Journal of Integer Sequences, Vol.6(2003), by J.-M. Koninck and N. Doyon.  \\n']"

We will solve the problem in two steps.  \\n\\nFirst step. The number $2a b c-a b-b c-c a$ cannot be expressed in the required form. Assume contrary, that:  \\n\\n$$\\n2a b c-a b-b c-c a=x b c+y c a+z a b,\\n$$  \\n\\nwhere $x,y,z\\\\geq0$ .

Any number $N$ , $N>2a b c-a b-b c-c a$ , can be expressed in the form $N=x b c+y c a+z a b$ .  \\n\\nFirst, observe that $2a b c-a b-b c-c a+1>0$ . It follows by the following argument:  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{a b c}(2a b c-a b-b c-c a+1)=2-\\\\frac{1}{a}-\\\\frac{1}{b}-\\\\frac{1}{c}+\\\\frac{1}{a b c}>2-\\\\frac{1}{1}-\\\\frac{1}{2}-\\\\frac{1}{3}+\\\\frac{1}{a b c}>0.\\n$$  \\n\\nGoing further, we have two situations. When $N\\\\equiv0$ (mod abc), since $N=a b c q$ , we may consider the combination $N=(a b)c q+b c\\\\cdot0+c a\\\\cdot0$ . It is of required form, under notations $x=y=0$ and $z=c q$ .  \\n\\nSuppose that $N\\\\not\\\\equiv0$ (mod $a b c$ ). Because $g c d(b c,a)=1$ , the congruence  \\n\\n$$\\nx b c\\\\equiv N{\\\\pmod{a}}\\n$$  \\n\\nhas a solution $x_{0}$ , $0<x_{0}<a$ . Similarly, the congruences  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{c c}{{y c a\\\\equiv N}}&{{(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ b)}}\\\\\\\\ {{}}&{{}}\\\\\\\\ {{z a b\\\\equiv N}}&{{(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ c)}}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nhave solutions $y_{0},z_{0}$ , respectively, $0<y_{0}<b$ , $0<x_{0}<c$ .  \\n\\nLet $A=x_{0}b c+y_{0}c a+z_{0}a b$ . Then we have:  \\n\\n$$\\nA\\\\equiv x_{0}b c\\\\equiv N{\\\\pmod{a}},\\\\quad A\\\\equiv N{\\\\pmod{b}},\\\\quad A\\\\equiv N{\\\\pmod{c}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nSince $a,b,c$ are pairwise respectively prime, we obtain $A\\\\equiv N$ (mod abc).  \\n\\nThe number $A$ is a combination of required form. Since $x_{0}~\\\\leq~a-1$ , $y_{0}\\\\leq b-1$ , and $z_{0}\\\\le c-1$ it follows that $A\\\\leq3a b c-b c-c a-a b$ . Using $A\\\\equiv N$ (mod abc), we may write $N=A+k a b c$ . In this sum $k\\\\geq0$ , since $N>2a b c-b c-c a-a b$ .

We will prove by induction that $2^{n+1}$ appears in exactly $n$ Pythagorean triples. The base case $n=1$ holds for $(3,2^{2},5)$ is the only such triple. Assume that $(x_{k},y_{k},z_{k})$ , where $x_{k}=u_{k}^{2}-v_{k}^{2}$ , $y_{k}=2u_{k}v_{k}$ , $z_{k}=$ $u_{k}^{2}+v_{k}^{2}$ , $k=1,\\\\dots,n$ are the $n$ triples containing $2^{n+1}$ .

Find all odd positive integers n greater than 1 such that for any relatively prime divisors a and $b$ of $n$ , the number $a+b-1$ is also a divisor of $n$ .  \\n\\n(2001 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. We will call a number ”good” if it satisfies the given conditions. It is not difficult to see that all prime powers are good. Suppose $n$ is a good number that has at least two distinct prime factors. Let $n=p^{r}s$ , where $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $n$ and $s$ is not divisible by $p$ . Because $n$ is good, $p+s-1$ must divide $n$ . For any prime $q$ dividing $s$ , $s<p+s-1<s+q$ , so $q$ does not divide $p+s-1$ . Therefore, the only prime factor of $p+s-1$ is $p$ . Then $s=p^{c}-p+1$ for some $c>1$ . Because $p^{c}$ must also divide $n$ , $p^{c}+s-1=2p^{c}-p$ divides $n$ . Because $2p^{c-1}-1$ has no factors of $p$ , it must divide $s$ . But a simple computation shows that $\\\\frac{p-1}{2}<\\\\frac{p^{c}-p+1}{2p^{c-1}-1}<\\\\frac{p+1}{2}$ , therefore $2p^{c-1}-1$ cannot divide $s$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Find all positive integers n such that $3^{n-1}+5^{n-1}$ divides $3^{n}+5^{n}$ .  \\n\\n(1996 St. Petersburg City Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. This only occurs for $n=1$ . Let $s_{n}=3^{n}+5^{n}$ and note that  \\n\\n$$\\ns_{n}=(3+5)s_{n-1}-3\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot s_{n-2}\\n$$  \\n\\nso $s_{n-1}$ must also divide $3\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot s_{n-2}$ . If $n>1$ , then $s_{n-1}$ is coprime to 3 and 5, so $s_{n-1}$ must divide $s_{n-2}$ , which is impossible since $s_{n-1}>s_{n-2}$ .  \\n\\nRemark. Alternatively, note that < 3n−1 + 5n−1 < 5 so we can only have n31 + 5n 1 ∈ {2, 3, 4} cases which are easily checked.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Find all positive integers $n$ such that the set  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left\\\\{n,n+1,n+2,n+3,n+4,n+5\\\\right\\\\}\\n$$  \\n\\ncan be split into two disjoint subsets such that the products of elements in these subsets are the same.  \\n\\n( $12^{t h}$ IMO)  \\n\\nSolution. At least one of six consecutive numbers is divisible by 5. From the given condition it follows that two numbers must be divisible by 5. These two numbers are necessarily $n$ and $n+5$ . Therefore $n$ and $n+5$ are in distinct subsets. Since $n(n+1)>n+5$ , it follows that a required partition cannot be considered with subsets of different cardinality. Thus each subset must contain three numbers. The following possibilities have to be considered:  \\n\\na) $\\\\{n,n+2,n+4\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\{n+1,n+3,n+5\\\\}$ b) $\\\\{n,n+3,n+4\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\{n+1,n+2,n+5\\\\}.$ In case a), $n<n+1$ , $n+2<n+3$ and $n+4<n+5$ . In case b), the condition of the problem gives:  \\n\\n$$\\nn(n+3)(n+4)=(n+1)(n+3)(n+5).\\n$$  \\n\\nWe obtain $n^{2}+5n+10=0$ and this equation has no real solution.  \\n\\nRemark. One can prove that if $p$ is a prime of the form $4k+3$ , then one cannot partition $p-1$ consecutive integers in two classes with equal product. This problem is the particular case $p=7$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem. The positive integers $d_{1},d_{2},\\\\ldots,d_{n}$ divide 1995.

Note that $3\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot7\\\\cdot19=1995$ . If the chosen divisors include one divisible by 19 and another not divisible by 19, the quotient of the two has numerator divisible by 19, solving the problem since $n\\\\leq16$ . If this is not the case, either all divisors are or divisible by 19 or none of them has this property, and in particular $n\\\\leq8$ . Without loss of generality, assume the divisors are all not divisible by 19.  \\n\\nUnder this assumption, we are done if the divisors include one divisible by 7 and another not divisible by 7, unless $n=8$ . In the latter case all of the divisors not divisible by 19 occur, including 1 and $3\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot7$ , so this case also follows. We now assume that none of the chosen divisors is divisible by 4, so that in particular $n\\\\leq4$ .  \\n\\nAgain, we are done if the divisors include one divisible by 5 and another not divisible by 5. But this can only fail to occur if $n=1$ or $n=2$ . The former case is trivial, while in the latter case we simply divide the larger divisor by the smaller one, and the resulting numerator has at least one prime divisor and so is at least 3. Hence the problem is solved in all cases.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Determine all pairs $(a,b)$ of positive integers such that $a b^{2}+b+7$ divides $a^{2}b+a+b$ .  \\n\\n( $39^{t h}$ IMO)  \\n\\nSolution.

Observe that all pairs $(7k^{2},7k)$ , $k\\\\geq1$ are solutions for the problem.  \\n\\nSuppose $b^{2}-7a>0$ . Then $a b^{2}+b+7\\\\leq b^{2}-7a$ and we get a contradiction:  \\n\\n$$\\nb^{2}-7a<b^{2}<a b^{2}+b+7.\\n$$  \\n\\nSuppose $b^{2}-7a<0$ . Then $a b^{2}+b+7\\\\leq7a-b^{2}$ .

Find all integers $a,b,c$ with $1<a<b<c$ such that $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1)$ is a divisor of $a b c-1$ .  \\n\\nSolution. It is convenient to note $a-1=x$ , $b-1=y$ and $c-1=z$ . Then we have the conditions: $1\\\\leq x<y<z$ and $x y z|x y+y z+z x+x+y+z$ .  \\n\\nThe idea of the solution is to point out that we cannot have $x y z\\\\ \\\\leq$ $x y+y z+z x+x+y+z$ for infinitely many triples $(x,y,z)$ of positive integers. Let $f(x,y,z)$ be the quotient of the required divisibility.  \\n\\nFrom the algebraic form:  \\n\\n$$\\nf(x,y,z)={\\\\frac{1}{x}}+{\\\\frac{1}{y}}+{\\\\frac{1}{z}}+{\\\\frac{1}{x y}}+{\\\\frac{1}{y z}}+{\\\\frac{1}{z x}}\\n$$  \\n\\nwe can see that $f$ is decreasing function in one of the variables $x,y,z$ . By symmetry and because $x,y,z$ are distinct numbers,  \\n\\n$$\\nf(x,y,z)\\\\leq f(1,2,3)=2+{\\\\frac{5}{6}}<3.\\n$$  \\n\\nThus, if the divisibility is fulfilled we can have either $f(x,y,z)=1$ or $f(x,y,z)=2$ . So, we have to solve in positive integers the equations  \\n\\n$$\\nx y+y z+z x+x+y+z=k x y z\\n$$  \\n\\nwhere $k=1$ or $k=2$ .  \\n\\nObserve that $f(3,4,5)={\\\\frac{59}{60}}<1$ . Thus $x\\\\in\\\\{1,2\\\\}$ . Also $f(2,3,4)={\\\\frac{35}{24}}<$ 2. Thus, for $x=2$ , we necessarily have $k=1$ . The conclusion is that only three equations have to be considered in (1).  \\n\\nCase 1. $x=1$ and $k=1$ . We obtain the equation:  \\n\\n$$\\n1+2(y+z)+y z=y z.\\n$$  \\n\\nIt has no solutions.  \\n\\nCase 2. $x=1$ and $k=2$ . We obtain the equation:  \\n\\n$$\\n1+2(y+z)=y z.\\n$$  \\n\\nWrite it under the form: $(y-2)(z-2)=5$ and obtain $y-2=1$ , $z-2=5$ It has a unique solution: $y=3$ , $z=7$ .  \\n\\nCase 3. $x=2$ and $k=1$ . We obtain the equation:  \\n\\n$$\\n2+3(y+z)=y z.\\n$$  \\n\\nBy writing it under the form: $(y-3)(z-3)=11$ we find $y-3=1$ , $z-3=11$ . Thus, it has a unique solution: $y=4$ , $z=15$ .  \\n\\nFrom Case 2 and Case 3 we obtain respectively: $a=2$ , $b=4$ , $c=8$ and $a=3$ , $b=5$ , $c=16$ . These are the solutions of the problem.  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

We shall use the following well-known fact: if $p$ is prime of the form $4q+3$ and if it divides $x^{2}+y^{2}$ then $p$ divides $x$ and $y$ . (For $p=3$ , $7$ , 19 the last statement can be proved directly). If $k$ is divisible by 3, then $x$ and $y$ are divisible by 3 too. Simplifying by 9 we get an equality of the form $x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}=k_{1}(x_{1}-y_{1})$ , where $k_{1}$ divides $5\\\\cdot7\\\\cdot19$ .

No, there is always a number congruent to 3 modulo 4: factoring such a number gives one factor congruent to 3 modulo 4, and changing that by 2 in either direction gives a number congruent to 3 modulo 4.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Find the smallest positive integer which can be written both as (i) a sum of 2002 positive integers (not necessarily distinct), each of which has the same sum of digits and (ii) as a sum of 2003 positive integers (not necessarily distinct), each of which has the same sum of digits.  \\n\\n(2002 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. The answer is 10010. First observe that this is indeed a solution: $10010=2002{\\\\cdot}5=1781{\\\\cdot}4+222{\\\\cdot}13$ , so we may express 10010 as the sum of 2002 fives or of 1781 fours and 222 thirteens, where $1781+222=2003$ . To prove minimality, observe that a number is congruent modulo 9 to the sum of its digits, so two positive integers with the same digit sum are in the same residue class modulo 9. Let $k_{1}$ be the digit sum of the 2002 numbers and $k_{2}$ the digit sum of the 2003 numbers. Then $4k_{1}\\\\equiv2002k_{1}\\\\equiv2003k_{2}\\\\equiv5k_{2}$ (mod 9).

However, the solutions $k_{1}\\\\equiv1,2,3,4$ (mod 9) give $k_{2}\\\\equiv8,7,6,5$ , respectively, so that at least one of $k_{1}$ or $k_{2}$ is greater than or equal to 5, and the minimal integer is 10010.  \\n\\n# Proposed problems  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

We show that $n=2$ is the only such integer. It is clear that $n=2$ satisfies the conditions. For $n>2$ , write  \\n\\n$$\\nn^{6}-1=(n^{3}-1)(n^{3}+1)=(n^{3}-1)(n+1)(n^{2}-n+1);\\n$$  \\n\\nhence, all prime factors of $n^{2}-n+1$ must divide $n^{3}-1$ or $n^{2}-1=$ $(n-1)(n+1).$ Note, however, that $\\\\left(n^{2}-n+1,n^{3}-1\\\\right)\\\\leq\\\\left(n^{3}+1,n^{3}-1\\\\right)\\\\leq2$ ; on the other hand, $n^{2}-n+1=n(n-1)+1$ is odd, so all prime factors of $n^{2}-n+1$ must divide $n+1$ . But $n^{2}-n+1=(n+1)(n-2)+3$ , so we must have $n^{2}-n+1=3^{k}$ for some $k$ . Because $n>2$ , we have $k\\\\geq2$ .

In particular, the values of $g(n)$ modulo 3 are $g(1)=1,1,1,2,0,1,0,0,\\\\ldots$ repeating with period 8.  \\n\\nNow let $h(n)=f(n)-g(n);h(n)$ counts permutations of the desired form where $n$ occurs in the middle, sandwiched between $n{-}1$ and $n{-}2$ . Removing $n$ leaves an acceptable permutation, and any acceptable permutation on $n-1$ symbols can be so produced except those ending in $n-4,n-2,n-3$ , $n-1$ . Hence $h(n)=h(n-1)+g(n-1)-g(n-4)=h(n-1)+g(n-2)$ ; one checks that $h(n)$ modulo 3 repeats with period 24.  \\n\\nSince $1996\\\\equiv4$ (mod 24), we have $f(1996)\\\\equiv f(4)=4$ (mod 3), so $f(1996)$ is not divisible by 3.  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

Knowing $2^{29}$ an 9-digit number whose digits are distinct, without computing the actual number determine which of the ten digits is missing. Justify your answer.  \\n\\nSolution. It is not difficult to see that, when divided by 9, the remainder is 5. The ten-digit number containing all digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is a multiple of 9, because the sum of its digits has this property. So, in our nine-digit number, 4 is missing.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. It is well known that the divisibility tests for division by 3 and 9 do not depend on the order of the decimal digits. Prove that 3 and 9 are the only positive integers with this property.

Let $d$ be a $k$ -digit number. Then among the $\\\\left(k+2\\\\right)$ -digit numbers starting with 10 there is at least one that is divisible by $d$ .

Note that any product of any two numbers from $\\\\{1,3,7,9\\\\}$ taken modulo 20 is still in $\\\\{1,3,7,9\\\\}$ . Therefore any finite product of such numbers is still in this set.

The number $d n$ contains exactly one more prime factor than $n$ . As for $(d-1)n$ , it is divisible by 2 because $d-1$ is even. Its odd factors are less than $d$ so they all divide $n$ .

The values are $k=(p+1)^{2}/4$ for $p$ odd (and none for $p=2$ ). We first consider $p=2$ , in which case we need $k^{2}-2k=(k-1)^{2}-1$ to be a positive square, which is impossible, as the only consecutive squares are 0 and 1.  \\n\\nNow assume $p$ is odd. We first rule out the case where $k$ is divisible by $p$ : if $k=n p$ , then $k^{2}-p k=p^{2}n(n-1)$ , and $n$ and $n-1$ are consecutive numbers, so they cannot both be squares.  \\n\\nWe thus assume $k$ and $p$ are coprime, in which case $k$ and $k-p$ are coprime. Thus $k^{2}-p k$ is a square if and only if $k$ and $k-p$ are squares, say $k=m^{2}$ and $k-p=n^{2}$ .

The only solution is $l=m=n=2$ . Let $d=g c d(l,m,n)$ , and put $l=d l_{1}$ , $m=d m_{1}$ , $n=d n_{1}$ . Then $d(m_{1}+n_{1})=d^{2}d_{m n}^{2}$ , where $d_{m n}=g c d(m_{1},n_{1})$ , so $m_{1}+n_{1}=d d_{m n}^{2}$ . Defining $d_{l n}$ and $d_{l m}$ likewise, we get  \\n\\n$$\\n2(l_{1}+m_{1}+n_{1})=d(d_{l m}^{2}+d_{l n}^{2}+d_{m n}^{2}).\\n$$  \\n\\nSince $\\\\frac{d}{g c d(d,2)}$ divides $l_{1}+m_{1}+n_{1}$ as well as $m_{1}+n_{1}$ , it divides $l_{1}$ and likewise $m_{1}$ and $n_{1}$ . As these three numbers are relatively prime, we have $\\\\frac{d}{g c d(d,2)}=1$ and so $d\\\\leq2$ .  \\n\\nNote that $d_{l m},d_{l n},d_{m n}$ are pairwise relatively prime; therefore we can write $l_{1}=l_{2}d_{l m}d_{l n}$ , $m_{1}=m_{2}d_{l m}d_{m n}$ , $n_{1}=n_{2}d_{l n}d_{m n}$ . Then we have  \\n\\n$$\\nd_{l m}d_{m n}m_{2}+d_{l n}d_{m n}n_{2}=d d_{m n}^{2}\\n$$  \\n\\nand so $m_{2}d_{l m}+n_{2}d_{l n}=d d_{m n}$ and so forth. Assuming without loss of generality that $d_{m n}$ is no larger than $d_{l m},d_{l n}$ , we get  \\n\\n$$\\n2d_{m n}\\\\geq d d_{m n}=d_{l m}m_{2}+d_{l n}n_{2}\\\\geq d_{l m}+d_{l n}\\\\geq2d_{m n}.\\n$$  \\n\\nThus we have equality throughout: $d=2$ , $m_{2}=n_{2}=1$ and $d_{l m}=d_{l n}=$ $d_{m n}$ . But these three numbers are pairwise relatively prime, so they are all 1. Then $m_{1}=n_{1}=1$ and from $l_{1}+m_{1}=d d_{l m}^{2}$ , $l_{1}=1$ as well. Therefore $l=m=n=2$ .  \\n']"

         "['Problem. 1) Let a be a positive integer. Prove that any prime factor $>2$ of $a^{2}+1$ is of the form $4m+1$ .  \\n\\n2) Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $4m+1$ .  \\n\\nSolution. 1) Assume that $p|a^{2}+1$ and $p=4m+3$ for some integer $m$ . Then $a^{2}\\\\equiv-1$ (mod $p$ ) and $a^{p-1}=(a^{2})^{2m+1}\\\\equiv(-1)^{2m+1}\\\\equiv-1$ (mod $p$ ), contradicting Fermat’s Little Theorem.  \\n\\n2) The integer $(n!)^{2}+1$ is of the form $4m+1$ , hence all its prime factors are of this form. It follows that for any prime $p$ of the form $4m+1$ , $(p!)^{2}+1$ is a prime or has a prime factor $p_{1}>p$ and we are done.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. For any prime $p$ , $p^{p+1}+(p+1)^{p}$ is not a perfect square.  \\n\\nSolution. For $p=2$ the property holds. Assume by way of contradiction that $p\\\\geq3$ and $p^{p+1}+(p+1)^{p}=t^{2}$ for some positive integer $t$ . It follows that $(t+p^{\\\\frac{p+1}{2}})(t-p^{\\\\frac{p+1}{2}})=(p+1)^{p}$ , hence $t\\\\pm p^{\\\\frac{p+1}{2}}=2^{p-1}u^{p}$ and $t\\\\mp p^{\\\\frac{p+1}{2}}=2v^{p}$ , for some positive integers $u,v$ such that $2u v=p+1$ and $g c d(u,v)=1$ . We obtain $p^{\\\\frac{p+1}{2}}=|2^{p-2}u^{p}-v^{p}|$ . Using Fermat’s Little Theorem we have $u^{p}\\\\equiv u$ (mod $p$ ), $v^{p}\\\\equiv v$ (mod $p$ ) and $2^{p-1}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ), so $u\\\\equiv2v$ (mod $p$ ). From $2u v=p+1$ we get $u=2v$ and finally $v=1$ and $p=3$ . This leads to $t^{2}=145$ , a contradiction.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Let $n\\\\geq2$ , $a>0$ be integers and $p$ a prime such that $a^{p}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p^{n}$ ). Show that if $p>2$ , then $a\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p^{n-1}$ ), and if $p=2$ , then $a\\\\equiv\\\\pm1$ (mod $2^{n-1}$ ).  \\n\\n(1995 UNESCO Mathematical Contest)  \\n\\nSolution. We have $a^{p}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p)^{n}$ with $n\\\\geq2$ , so $a^{p}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). But, from Fermat’s Little Theorem, $a^{p}\\\\equiv a$ (mod $p$ ), hence $a\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{p}}$ . For $a=1$ , the result is obvious; otherwise, put $a=1+k p^{d}$ , where $d\\\\geq1$ and $p\\\\nmid k$ . Then for $p>2$ , $a^{p}=1+k p^{d+1}+M p^{2d+1}$ for $M$ an integer. Therefore $d+1\\\\geq n$ and so $s\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p^{n-1}$ ). In case $p=2$ , we have $2^{n}|a^{2}-1=(a-1)(a+1)$ . Since these differ by 2, both cannot be multiples of 4. Hence either $a+1$ or $a-1$ is divisible by $2^{n-1}$ , i.e. $a\\\\equiv\\\\pm1$ (mod $2^{n-1}$ ), as desired.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Find the smallest integer n such that among any $n$ integers, there exist $1\\\\delta$ integers whose sum is divisible by 18.  \\n\\n(1997 Ukrainean Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. The minimum is $n=35$ ; the 34-element set of 17 zeroes and 17 ones shows that $n\\\\geq35$ , so it remains to show that among 35 integers, there are 18 whose sum is divisible by 18. In fact, one can show that for any $n$ , among $2n-1$ integers there are $n$ whose sum is divisible by $n$ .  \\n\\nWe show this claim by induction on $n$ ; it’s clear for $n=1$ . If $n$ is composite, say $n=p q$ , we can assemble sets of $p$ integers whose sum is divisible by $p$ as long as at least $2p-1$ numbers remain; this gives $2q-1$ sets, and again by the induction hypothesis, some $q$ of these have sum divisible by $q$ .  \\n\\nNow suppose $n=p$ is prime. The number $x$ is divisible by $p$ if and only if $x^{p-1}\\\\not\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). Thus if the claim is false, then the sum of $(a_{1}+$ $\\\\cdots+a_{p})^{p-1}$ over all subsets $\\\\{a_{1},\\\\ldots,a_{p}\\\\}$ of the given numbers is congruent to ${\\\\binom{2p-1}{p-1}}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). On the other hand, the sum of $a_{1}^{e_{1}}\\\\dots a_{p}^{e_{p}}$ for $e_{1}+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+e_{p}\\\\leq p-1$ is always divisible by $p$ : if $k\\\\le p-1$ of the $e_{i}$ are nonzero, then each product is repeated $\\\\binom{2p-1-k}{p-k}$ times, and the latter is a multiple of $p$ . This contradiction shows that the claim holds in this case. (Note: to solve the original problem, of course it suffices to prove the cases $p=2,3$ directly).  \\n\\nRemark. The fact that for any $n$ , among $2n-1$ integers there are $n$ whose sum is divisible by $n$ is a famous theorem of Erdo¨s and Ginzburg.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Several integers are given (some of them may be equal) whose sum is equal to 1492. Decide whether the sum of their seventh powers can equal  \\n\\n(a) 1996;   \\n(b) 1998.  \\n\\n(1997 Czech-Slovak Match)  \\n\\nSolution. (a) Consider a set of 1492 1’s, 4 $2$ ’s, and 8 -1’s. Their sum is 1492, and the sum of their seventh powers is $1482(1)+4(128)+8(-1)=$ 1996.  \\n\\n(b) By Fermat’s Little Theorem, $x^{7}\\\\equiv x$ (mod 7). Thus, the sum of the numbers’ seventh powers must be congruent to the sum of the numbers, modulo 7. But $1998\\\\not\\\\equiv1492$ (mod 7), so the numbers’ seventh powers cannot add up to 1998.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Find the number of integers $n>1$ for which the number $a^{25}-a$ is divisible by n for each integer $a$ .  \\n\\n(1995 Bulgarian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. Let $n$ have the required property. Then $p^{2}$ ( $p$ a prime) does not divide $n$ since $p^{2}$ does not divide $p^{25}-p$ . Hence $n$ is the multiple of different prime numbers. On the other hand $2^{25}-2=2{\\\\cdot}3^{2}$ 5 7 13 17 241. But $n$ is not divisible by 17 and 241 since $3^{25}\\\\equiv-3$ (mod 17) and $3^{25}\\\\equiv32$ (mod 241). The Fermat Theorem implies that $a^{25}\\\\equiv a$ (mod $p$ ) when $p=2,3,5,7,13$ . Thus $n$ should be equal to the divisors of $2\\\\cdot3\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot7\\\\cdot13$ , which are different from 1 and there are $2^{5}-1=31$ of them.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. a) Find all positive integers n such that 7 divides $2^{n}-1$ . b) Prove that for any positive integer n the number $2^{n}+1$ cannot be divisible by 7.  \\n\\nSolution. Fermat’s Little Theorem gives:  \\n\\n$$\\n2^{6}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{7}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nIt follows from the divisibility $7|(2^{3}-1)(2^{3}+1)$ that $2^{3}\\\\equiv1$ (mod 7). Hence all numbers $n$ which are divisible by 3 answer to the question.  \\n\\nLet $n=3k+r$ where $r=1$ or $r=2$ . Then  \\n\\n$$\\n2^{n}\\\\equiv2^{3k+r}\\\\equiv(2^{3})^{k}\\\\cdot2^{r}=2{\\\\mathrm{~or~}}4{\\\\pmod{7}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nHence, we cannot obtain $2^{n}\\\\equiv-1{\\\\pmod{7}}$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Prove that the following are equivalent.  \\n\\n(a) For any positive integer $a,n$ divides $a^{n}-a$ . (b) For any prime divisor $p$ of $n,p^{2}$ does not divides n and $p-1$ divides $n-1$ .  \\n\\n(1995 Turkish Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. First assume (a). If $p^{2}|n$ for some prime $p$ , we must have $p^{2}|(p+1)^{p^{2}}-(p+1)$ . However,  \\n\\n$$\\n(p+1)^{p^{2}}-(p+1)=p^{2}-p+\\\\sum_{k=2}^{p^{2}}{\\\\binom{p^{2}}{k}}p^{k}.\\n$$  \\n\\nAll terms but the first are divisible by $p^{2}$ , contradicting the assumption. Therefore $p^{2}\\\\nmid n$ . Moreover, if $a$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ , then $a^{n-1}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ) implies $p-1|n-1$ .  \\n\\nOn the other hand, if $n$ is square-free and $p\\\\mathrm{~-~}1|n\\\\mathrm{~-~}1$ for all primes $p|n$ , then for any $a$ , either $p|a$ or $a^{p-1}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{p}}$ ; in either case $\\\\boldsymbol{a}^{n}\\\\equiv\\\\boldsymbol{a}$ (mod $p$ ) for all $p$ dividing $n$ . Hence the conditions are equivalent.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Prove that the sequence $\\\\{2^{n}-3|n=2,3,\\\\dots\\\\}$ contains infinitely many pairs of relatively prime numbers.  \\n\\nSolution. We use the induction. The numbers $2^{2}-3,2^{3}-3,2^{4}-3$ are pairwise relatively prime numbers. We shall prove that if $n_{1},n_{2},...,n_{k}$ are positive integers such that the members of the sequence  \\n\\n$$\\n2^{n_{1}}-3,2^{n_{2}}-3,\\\\ldots,2^{n_{k}}-3\\n$$  \\n\\nare relatively prime to each other, then there exists $n_{k+1}$ such that $2^{n_{k+1}}-3$ is relatively prime to each number of the sequence (1).  \\n\\nLet $\\\\{p_{1},p_{2},\\\\ldots,p_{r}\\\\}$ be the set of all prime divisors of numbers from the sequence (1). Then $p_{1},p_{2},\\\\ldots,p_{r}$ are odd prime numbers and by Fermat’s Little Theorem  \\n\\n$$\\n2^{p_{i}-1}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{p_{i}}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nIt follows that  \\n\\n$$\\n2^{(p_{1}-1)(p_{2}-1)\\\\ldots(p_{r}-1)}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{p_{i}}},\\\\forall i=1,\\\\ldots,r.\\n$$  \\n\\nLet $n_{k+1}=\\\\prod_{i=1}^{r}(p_{i}-1)$ . We shall prove that $2^{n_{i}}-3$ and $2^{n_{k+1}}-3$ , are relatively prime, for all $i=1,\\\\ldots,r$ . Let $p$ be a common prime divisor of $2^{n_{i}}-3$ and $2^{n_{k+1}}-3$ . Then $2^{n_{k+1}}-3\\\\equiv1-3$ (mod $p)\\\\equiv0$ (mod $p$ ); this is a contradiction.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Let $p>2$ be a prime number such that $3|(p-2)$ . Let  \\n\\nProve that at most $p$ elements of $S$ are divisible by $p$ .  \\n\\n(1999 Balkan Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. We need the following  \\n\\nLemma. Given a prime $p$ and a positive integer $k>1$ , if $k$ and $p-1$ are relatively prime then $x^{k}\\\\equiv y^{k}{\\\\pmod{p}}\\\\Rightarrow x\\\\equiv y$ (mod $p$ ) for all $x,y$ .  \\n\\nProof. If $y\\\\equiv0$ (mod $p$ ) the claim is obvious. Otherwise, note that $x^{k}\\\\equiv y^{k}\\\\Rightarrow(x y^{-1})^{k}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ), so it suffices to prove that $a^{k}\\\\equiv1$ $({\\\\bmod{p}})\\\\Rightarrow a\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ).  \\n\\nBecause $\\\\begin{array}{r}{g c d(p-1,k)=1}\\\\end{array}$ , there exist integers $b$ and $c$ such that $b(p\\\\mathrm{~-~}$ $1)+c k=1$ . Thus, $a^{k}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{p}}\\\\Rightarrow a^{c}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{p}}\\\\Rightarrow a^{1-b(p-1)}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). If $a=0$ this is impossible. Otherwise, by Fermat’s Little Theorem, $(a^{-b})^{p-1}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ) so that $a\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ), as desired.  \\n\\nAlternatively, again note that clearly $a\\\\ \\\\not\\\\equiv\\\\ 0$ (mod $p$ ). Then let $d$ be the order of $a$ , the smallest positive integer such that $\\\\boldsymbol{a}^{d}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ); we have $d|k$ . Take the set $\\\\{1,a,a^{2},\\\\ldots,a^{d-1}\\\\}$ . If it does not contain all of $1,2,\\\\ldots,p\\\\mathrm{~-~}1$ then pick some other element $b$ and consider the set $\\\\{b,b a,b a^{2},\\\\ldots,b a^{d-1}\\\\}$ . These two sets are disjoint, because otherwise $b a^{i}\\\\equiv a^{j}\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ b\\\\equiv a^{j-1}$ (mod $p$ ), a contradiction. Continuing similarly, we can partition $\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,p{-}1\\\\}$ into $d$ -element subsets, and hence $d|p{-}1$ . However, $d|k$ and $\\\\begin{array}{r}{g c d(k,p-1)=1}\\\\end{array}$ , implying that $d=1$ . Therefore $a\\\\equiv a^{d}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ), as desired. □  \\n\\nBecause $3|p-2,g c d(3,p-1)=1$ . Then from the claim, it follows that the set of elements $\\\\{1^{3},2^{3},\\\\dots,p^{3}\\\\}$ equals $\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,p\\\\}$ modulo $p$ . Hence, for each $y$ with $0\\\\leq y\\\\leq p-1$ , there is exactly one $x$ between $0$ and $p-1$ such that $x^{3}\\\\equiv y^{2}-1$ (mod $p$ ): that is, such that $p|y^{2}-x^{3}-1$ . Therefore $S$ contains at most $p$ elements divisible by $p$ , as desired.  \\n\\n# Proposed problems  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Let $3^{n}-2^{n}$ be a power of a prime for some positive integer n. Prove that $n$ is a prime.  \\n\\nSolution. Let $3^{n}-2^{n}=p^{\\\\alpha}$ for some prime $p$ and some $\\\\alpha\\\\geq1$ , and let $q$ be a prime divisor of $n$ . Assume that $q\\\\neq n$ ; then $n=k q$ , where $k>1$ . Since $p^{\\\\alpha}=3^{k q}-2^{k q}=(3^{k})^{q}-(2^{k})^{q}$ , we observe that $p^{\\\\alpha}$ is divisible by $3^{k}-2^{k}$ . Hence $3^{k}-2^{k}=p^{\\\\beta}$ for some $\\\\beta\\\\geq1$ . Now we have  \\n\\n$$\\np^{\\\\alpha}=(2^{k}+p^{\\\\beta})^{q}-2^{k q}\\n$$  \\n\\n$$\\n=q2^{k(q-1)}p^{\\\\beta}+\\\\frac{q(q-1)}{2}2^{k(q-2)}p^{2\\\\beta}+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+p^{q\\\\beta}.\\n$$  \\n\\nSince $\\\\alpha>\\\\beta$ (because $p^{\\\\beta}=3^{k}-2^{k}$ is less than $p^{\\\\alpha}\\\\ =\\\\ 3^{k q}\\\\-\\\\ 2^{k q}$ ), it follows that $p^{\\\\alpha}$ is divisible by a power of $p$ at least as great as $p^{\\\\beta+1}$ . Then the above equality implies that $p$ divides $q2^{k(q-1)}$ . On the other hand, $p$ is obviously odd and hence it divides $q$ . Being a prime, $q$ must be then equal to $p$ . Therefore $n=k q=k p$ and $p^{\\\\alpha}=(3^{p})^{k}-(2^{p})^{k}$ is divisible by $3^{p}-3^{p}$ , implying $3^{p}-2^{p}=p^{\\\\gamma}$ for some $\\\\gamma\\\\geq1$ .

It suffices to show that the number of $n$ -tuples $(x_{1},\\\\ldots,x_{n})\\\\in S$ with $f(x_{1},\\\\ldots,x_{n})\\\\neq0$ is divisible by 13, since $|S|=13^{n}$ is divisible by 13.

The solution is the set of all $(p,p-1)$ , for odd primes $p$ . The fact that all of these pairs are indeed solutions follows immediately from Fermat’s Little Theorem. Now we show that no other solutions exist.  \\n\\nSuppose that $(m,n)$ is a solution. Let $p$ be a prime dividing $m$ . We first observe that $p>n$ . Otherwise, we could take $a=p$ , and then $p^{n}-1$ would not be divisible by $p$ , and alone $m$ . Then because $n\\\\geq2$ , we have $p\\\\geq3$ and hence $p$ is odd.  \\n\\nNow we prove that $p<n+2$ . Suppose on the contrary that $p\\\\geq n+2$ . If $n$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even and less than $p$ . Otherwise, if $n$ is even, then $n+2$ is even and hence less than $p$ as well, because $p$ is odd. In either case, there exists an even $d$ such that $n<d<p$ with ${\\\\frac{d}{2}}\\\\leq n$ .

By Lagrange’s Theorem, however, this congruence can have at most $n$ roots, a contradiction.  \\n\\nThus, we have sandwiched $p$ between $n$ and $n{\\\\mathrel{+{2}}}$ , and the only possibility is that $p=n+1$ .

Suppose that for every prime $q$ , there exists an $n$ for which $n^{p}\\\\equiv p$ (mod $q$ ). Assume that $q=k p+1$ . By Fermat’s Little Theorem we deduce that $p^{k}\\\\equiv n^{k p}=n^{q-1}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $q$ ), so $q|p^{k}-1$ .  \\n\\nIt is known that any prime $q$ such that $q|\\\\frac{p^{p}-1}{p-1}$ must satisfy $q\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). Indeed, from $q|p^{q-1}-1$ it follows that $q|p^{g c d(p,q-1)}-1$ ; but $q\\\\nmid p-1$ becaus e p −1 ≡ 1 (mod p − 1), so gcd(p, q − 1) ̸= 1. Hence gcd(p, q − 1) = p. Now suppose q is any prime divisor of p − 1 . Then $q|g c d(p^{k}-1,p^{p}-1)=$ $p^{g c d(p,k)}-1$ , which implies that $g c d(p,k)>1$ , so $p|k$ . Consequently $q\\\\equiv1$ (mod p2). However, the number p − ${\\\\frac{p^{p}-1}{p-1}}=p^{p-1}+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+p+1$ must have at least one prime divisor that is not congruent to 1 modulo $p^{2}$ . Thus we arrived at a contradiction.  \\n\\nRemark. Taking $q\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{p}}$ is natural, because for every other $q,n^{p}$ takes all possible residues modulo $p$ (including $p$ too). Indeed, if $p\\\\nmid q-1$ , then there is an $r\\\\in\\\\mathbb N$ satisfying $p r\\\\equiv1$ (mod $q-1\\\\rfloor$ ); hence for any $a$ the congruence $n^{p}\\\\equiv a$ (mod $q$ ) has the solution $n\\\\equiv a^{r}~(\\\\mathrm{mod}~q)$ .  \\n\\nThe statement of the problem itself is a special case of the Chebotarev theorem.  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

Choose that $p_{i}$ which minimizes this quantity and write $p_{i}=1+2^{r_{i}}m_{i}$ with $m_{i}$ odd. Then of course we have $n\\\\equiv1$ (mod $2^{m_{i}}$ ). Hence we can write $n-1=$ $2^{m}t$ .

Then $p|2^{2^{n+1}}-1$ and consequently $o_{p}(2)|2^{n+1}$ . This ensures the existence of a positive integer $k\\\\leq n+1$ such that $o_{p}(2)+2^{k}$ . We will prove that in fact $k=n+1$ . The proof is easy. Indeed, if this is not the case, then $o_{p}(2)|2^{n}$ and so $p|2^{o_{p}(2)}-1|2^{2^{n}}-1$ . But this is impossible, since $p|2^{2^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}+1$ . Therefore, we have found that $o_{p}(2)=2^{n+1}$ and we have to prove that $o_{p}(2)|p-1|$ to finish the first part of the question. But this follows from the introduction.  \\n\\nThe second part is a direct consequence of the first. Indeed, it is enough to prove that there exists an infinite set of Fermat’s numbers $(2^{2^{n_{k}}+1)_{n_{k}>a}}$ any two relatively prime. Then we could take a prime factor of each such Fermat’s number and apply the first part to obtain that each such prime is of the form $2^{n}k+1$ . But not only it is easy to find such a sequence of Fermat’s coprime numbers, but in fact any two different Fermat’s numbers are relatively prime. Indeed, suppose that $d|g c d(2^{2^{n}}+1,2^{2^{n+k}}+1)$ . Then $d|2^{2^{n+1}}-1$ and so $d|2^{2^{n+k}}-1$ . Combining this with $d|2^{2^{n+k}}+1$ , we obtain a contradiction.

In fact, we will prove that any prime factor of $f_{p}(m)$ is relatively prime with $m(m-1)$ . Take such a prime divisor $q$ . Because $q|1+m+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+m^{p-1}$ , it is clear that $g c d(q,m)=1$ . Moreover, if $g c d(q,m-1)\\\\neq1$ , then $q|m-1$ and because $q|1+m+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+m^{p-1}$ , it follows that $q|p$ . But $p|m$ and we find that $q|m$ , which is clearly impossible.  \\n\\nMore difficult is b). But we are tempted to use a) and to explore the properties of $f_{p}(m)$ , just like in the previous problem. So, let us take a prime $q|f_{p}(m)$ for a certain positive integer $m$ divisible by $p$ . Then we have of course $q|m^{p}-1$ . But this implies that $o_{\\\\boldsymbol q}(m)|\\\\boldsymbol q$ and consequently $o_{q}(m)\\\\in\\\\{1,p\\\\}$ . If $o_{q}(m)~=~p$ , then $q\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). Otherwise, $q|m-$  \\n\\n1 and because $q|f_{p}(m)$ , we deduce that $q|p$ , hence $q\\\\ =\\\\ p$ . But we have seen while solving a) that this is not possible, so the only choice is $p|q-$ 1. Now, we need to find a sequence $(m_{k})_{k\\\\geq1}$ of multiples of $p$ such that $f_{p}(m_{k})$ are pairwise relatively prime. This is not as easy as in the first example. Anyway, just by trial and error, it is not difficult to find such a sequence. There are many other approaches, but we like the following one: take $m_{1}=p$ and $m_{k}=p f(m_{1})f_{p}(m_{2})\\\\ldots f_{p}(m_{k-1})$ . Let us prove that $f_{p}(m_{k})$ is relatively prime to $f_{p}(m_{1}),f_{p}(m_{2}),\\\\ldots,f_{p}(m_{k-1})$ . Fortunately, this is easy, since $f_{p}(m_{1})f_{p}(m_{2})\\\\ldots f_{p}(m_{k-1})|f_{p}(m_{k})-f_{p}(0)|f_{p}(m_{k})-1$ . The solution ends here.  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

Now, it is time to work with exponents. We have $2^{2005}|17^{2^{k}}-1$ . Using the factoring  \\n\\n$$\\n17^{2^{k}}-1=(17-1)(17+1)(17^{2}+1)\\\\dots(17^{2^{k-1}}+1),\\n$$  \\n\\nwe proceed by finding the exponent of 2 in each factor of this product. But this is not difficult, because for all $i\\\\geq0$ the number $17^{2^{t}}+1$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. Thus, $v_{2}(17^{2^{k}}-1)=4+k$ and the order is found by solving the equation $k+4=2005$ . Thus, $O_{2^{2005}}(17)=2^{2001}$ is the answer to the problem.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Find all prime numbers $p,q$ such that $p^{2}+1|2003^{q}+1$ and $q^{2}+1|2003^{p}+1$ .  \\n\\nSolution. Let us suppose that $p\\\\leq q$ . We discuss first the trivial case $p=2$ . In this case, $5|2003^{q}+1$ and it is easy to deduce that $q$ is even, hence $q=2$ , which is a solution of the problem. Now, suppose that $p>2$ and let $r$ be a prime factor of $p^{2}+1$ . Because $r|2003^{2q}\\\\mathrm{~-~}1$ , it follows that $o_{r}(2003)|2q$ . Suppose that $(q,o_{r}(2003))=1$ . Then $o_{r}(2003)|2$ and $r|2003^{2}-1=2^{3}\\\\cdot3\\\\cdot7\\\\cdot11\\\\cdot13\\\\cdot167$ . It seems that this is a dead end, since there are too many possible values for $r$ . Another simple observation narrows the number of possible cases: because $r|p^{2}+1$ , must be of the form $4k+1$ or equal to 2 and now we do not have many possibilities: $r\\\\in\\\\{2,13\\\\}$ . The case $r=13$ is also impossible, because $2003^{q}+1\\\\equiv2$ (mod 13) and $r|2003^{q}+1$ . So, we have found that for any prime factor $r$ of $p^{2}+1$ , we have either $r=2$ or $q|o_{r}(2003)$ , which in turn implies $q|r-1$ . Because $p^{2}+1$ is even, but not divisible by 4 and because any odd prime factor of it is congruent to 1 modulo $q$ , we must have $p^{2}+1\\\\equiv2$ (mod $q$ ). This implies that $p^{2}+1\\\\equiv2$ (mod $q$ ), that is $q|(p-1)(p+1)$ . Combining this with the assumption that $p\\\\leq q$ yields $q|p+1$ and in fact $q=p+1$ . It follows that $p=2$ , contradicting the assumption $p>2$ . Therefore the only pair is (2,2).  \\n\\n# Proposed problems  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Find all ordered triples of primes $(p,q,r)$ such that  \\n\\n$$\\np|q^{r}+1,q|r^{p}+1,r|p^{q}+1.\\n$$  \\n\\n(2003 USA IMO Team Selection Test)  \\n\\nSolution. It is quite clear that $p,q,r$ are distinct. Indeed, if for example $p=q$ , then the relation $p|q^{r}+1$ is impossible. We will prove that we cannot have $p,q,r>2$ . Suppose this is the case. The first condition $p|q^{r}+1$ implies $p|q^{2r}-1$ and so $o_{p}(q)|2r$ . If $o_{p}(q)$ is odd, it follows that $p|q^{r}-1$ , which combined with $p|q^{r}+1$ yields $p=2$ , which is impossible. Thus, $o_{p}(q)$ is either 2 or $2r$ . Could we have $o_{p}(q)=2r$ ? No, since this would imply that $2r|p-1$ and so $0\\\\equiv p^{q}+1$ ( $\\\\mod r)\\\\equiv2$ (mod $r$ ), that is $r\\\\ =\\\\ 2$ , false. Therefore, the only possibility is $o_{p}(q)=2$ and so $p|q^{2}-1$ . We cannot have p|q − 1, because p|qr + 1 and p ̸= 2. Thus, p|q + 1 and in fact p| q +2 1 . In the same way, we find that $q|\\\\frac{r+1}{2}$ and r p + 1 . $r|\\\\frac{p+1}{2}$ This is clearly impossible, just by looking at the largest among $p,q,r$ . So, our assumption was wrong and indeed one of the three primes must equal 2. Suppose without loss of generality that $p=2$ . Then $q$ is odd, $q|r^{2}+1$ and $r|2^{q}+1$ . Similarly, $o_{r}(2)|2q$ . If $q|o_{r}(2)$ , then $q|r-1$ and so $q|r^{2}+1-(r^{2}-1)=2$ , which contradicts the already established result that $q$ is odd. Thus, $o_{r}(2)|2$ and $r|3$ . As a matter of fact, this implies that $r=3$ and $q=5$ , yielding the triple (2,5,3). It is immediate to verify that this triple satisfies all conditions of the problem. Moreover, all solutions are given by cyclic permutations of the components of this triple.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Find all primes $p,q$ such that $p q|2^{p}+2^{q}$ .  \\n\\nSolution.

Write $p-1=2^{l}n$ , $q-1=2^{k}m$ , where $l,k$ are odd positive integers. Because $p q|2^{p}+2^{q}$ , using Fermat’s Little Theorem, we obtain $0\\\\equiv2^{p}+2^{q}\\\\equiv2^{p}+2$ (mod $q$ ). It follows $2^{p-1}\\\\equiv-1$ (mod $q$ ). If we denote $x=2^{n}$ , then we have $x^{2^{l}}\\\\equiv-1$ (mod $q$ ), hence $o(x)=2^{l+1}$ (since $x^{2^{l+1}}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{q}}$ and $x^{2^{l}}\\\\not\\\\equiv1$ (mod $q$ )). It follows $2^{l+1}=o_{q}(x)|\\\\varphi(q)=$ $q-1=2^{k}m$ , i.e. $l+1\\\\leq k$ .  \\n\\nIn similar way we can prove that $k+1\\\\leq l$ and we get $l\\\\leq k-1\\\\leq l-2$ , a contradiction.

If, for example, $q=2$ , then $p|2^{p}+2^{q}=2^{p}+2^{2}$ , $0\\\\equiv2^{p}+2^{2}\\\\equiv2+2^{2}=6$ (mod $p$ ), and we get $p\\\\in\\\\{2,3\\\\}$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

We must have $48|k!$ , so $k\\\\geq7=6$ ; one checks that $k=6$ does not yield a solution, so $k\\\\geq7$ .

Given 81 natural numbers whose prime divisors belong to the set $\\\\{2,3,5\\\\}$ , prove there exist 4 numbers whose product is the fourth power of an integer.  \\n\\n(1996 Greek Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. It suffices to take 25 such numbers. To each number, associate the triple $(x_{2},x_{3},x_{5})$ recording the parity of the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 is its prime factorization. Two numbers have the same triple if and only if their product is a perfect square. As long as there are 9 numbers left, we can select two whose product is a square; in so doing, we obtain 9 such pairs. Repeating the process with the square roots of the products of the pairs, we obtain four numbers whose product is a fourth power.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Find all collections of 100 positive integers such that the sum of the fourth powers of every four of the integers is divisible by the product of the four numbers.  \\n\\n(1997 St. Petersburg City Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. Such sets must be $n,n,\\\\ldots,n$ or $\\\\ 3n,n,n,\\\\ldots,n$ for some integer $n$ . Without loss of generality, we assume the numbers do not have a common factor. If $u,v,w,x,y$ are five of the numbers, then $u v w$ divides $u^{4}+v^{4}+$ $w^{4}+x^{4}$ and $u^{4}+v^{4}+w^{4}+y^{4}$ , and so divides $x^{4}-y^{4}$ . Likewise, $v^{4}\\\\equiv$ $w^{4}\\\\equiv x^{4}$ (mod $u$ ), and from above, $3v^{4}\\\\equiv0$ (mod $u$ ). If $u$ has a prime divisor not equal to 3, we conclude that every other integer is divisible by the same prime, contrary to assumption. Likewise, if $u$ is divisible by 9, then every other integer is divisible by 3. Thus all of the numbers equal $1$ or 3. Moreover, if one number is 3, the others are all congruent modulo 3, so are all 3 (contrary to assumption) or 1. This completes the proof.  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

There are nine prime numbers less than 26: $p_{1}=2$ , $p_{2}=3,\\\\ldots$ $p_{9}=23\\\\$ . Any element $x$ of $M$ has a representation $x=\\\\prod_{i=1}^{9}p_{i}^{a_{i}}$ , $a_{i}\\\\geq0$ .

Equivalently, $a_{i}\\\\equiv b_{i}$ (mod 2) for all $i=1,2,\\\\ldots,9$ . Because there are $2^{9}=512$ elements in $(\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z})^{9}$ any subset of $M$ having at least 513 elements contains two elements $x,y$ such that $x y$ is a perfect square. Starting from $M$ and eliminating such pairs one finds ${\\\\frac{1}{2}}(1985-513)=736>513$ distinct two-element subsets of $M$ having a square as the product of elements.

It is easy to check that $38^{2}=1444$ is the first positive integer whose square ends in three 4’s. Now let $n$ be any such positive integer. Then $n^{2}-38^{2}=(n-38)(n+38)$ is divisible by $1000=2^{3}\\\\cdot5^{3}$ . Hence at least one of $n-38$ , $n+38$ is divisible by 4, and thus both are, since their difference is $76=4\\\\cdot19$ . Since $5\\\\nmid76$ , then 5 divides only one of the two factors. Consequently $n-38$ or $n+38$ is a multiple of $4\\\\cdot5^{3}=500$ , so we have $n=500k\\\\pm38$ .

It would follow in this case that $2^{3^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}+1$ has at least $n-1$ distinct prime divisors of the form $8k+3$ (from the previous remarks) and since it is also divisible by 3, the conclusion would follow.

Because any odd prime different from 3 is of one of the forms $12k\\\\pm1$ , $12k\\\\pm5$ and since $2^{n}-$ $1\\\\equiv7$ (mod 12), it follows that $2^{n}-1$ has at least a prime divisor of the form $12k\\\\pm5$ , call it $p$ .

The sequence modulo 4 thus proceeds 1, 3, $0$ , 3, 3, 2, 1, 3,. . . in a cycle of 6, so the sum of squares of any six consecutive terms in congruent to $1^{2}+3^{2}+0^{2}+3^{2}+$ $3^{2}+2^{2}\\\\equiv0$ (mod 4).  \\n\\nNow let us work modulo 5, in which case $a_{n+2}\\\\equiv a_{n+1}+4a_{n}$ if $n$ is even and $a_{n+2}\\\\equiv4a_{n+1}$ if $n$ is odd.

Then $d|(2p+q-q)$ or $d|2p$ . Since is odd, $d$ must also be odd. So $q$ $(d,2)=1$ and therefore $d|p$ . Because $d|p,d|q$ , and $(p,q)=1$ , $d$ must equal 1. Therefore $(2p+q,q)=1$ and since $2p+q\\\\mathrm{a}$ and $q$ are both odd as well, $a_{n}$ satisfies the conditions stated in the lemma, thus completing the inductive step.  \\n\\nCase 2. an = p / $a_{n}=\\\\frac{p}{q}/\\\\left(2+\\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{p}{2q+p}$ . Again suppose d divides both the numerator $p$ and denominator $2p+q$ . Then $d|(2p+q-p)$ or $d|2q$ . But since $p$ is odd, $d$ is odd, and so $d|q$ . Because $(p,q)=1$ , $d$ is equal to 1 and so $(p,2q+p)=1$ . Since $p$ and $2q+p$ are odd and are relatively prime, $a_{n}$ satisfies the conditions and completes the proof.  \\n\\nWe must now only consider the case where $a_{2001}=1/2$ . In this case, $a_{2000}$ is either 2 or $5/7$ . If it is 2, the conditions of the problem are violated.

Suppose that $a_{1},a_{2},\\\\dotsc$ . is a sequence of natural numbers such that for all natural numbers m and n, gcd(am, an) = agcd(m,n). Prove that there exists a sequence $b_{1},b_{2},\\\\dotsc$ of natural numbers such that $a_{n}=\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}b_{d}$ for all integers $n\\\\geq1$ .  \\n\\n(2001 Iranian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. For each $n$ , let $\\\\operatorname{rad}(n)$ denote the largest square-free divisor of $n$ (i.e. the product of all distinct prime factors of $n$ ). We let $b_{n}$ equal to the ratio of the following two numbers:  \\n\\n$E_{n}$ , the product of all $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$ such that $d$ is square-free, divides $n$ , and has an even number of prime factors.   \\n$O_{n}$ , the product of all $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$ such that $d$ is square-free, divides $n$ , and has an odd number of prime factors.  \\n\\nLemma 1. $\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid a_{n}}b_{d}=a_{n}.$  \\n\\nProof. Fix $n$ , and observe that $\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}b_{n}$ equals  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}E_{d}}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}O_{d}}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nIn the numerator of $(*)$ , each $E_{d}$ is the product of $a_{m}$ such that $m|d$ . Also, $d|n$ , implying that the numerator is the product of various $a_{m}$ such that $m|n$ . For fixed $m$ that divides $n$ , how many times does $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator $\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}E_{d}$ of (∗)?  \\n\\nIf $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ and $d|n$ , then let $t=d/m$ . By the definition of $E_{d}$ , we know that (i) $t$ is square-free and (ii) $t$ has an even number of prime factors. Because $d|n$ and $t=d/m$ , we further know that (iii) $t$ divides $n/m$ .  \\n\\nConversely, suppose that $t$ is any positive integer satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), and write $d=t m$ . By (iii), $d$ is a divisor of $n$ . Also, $t$ is square-free by (i), is a divisor of $d$ , and has an even number of prime factors by (ii). Thus, $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ .  \\n\\nSuppose that $n/m$ has $\\\\it l$ distinct prime factors. Then it has ${\\\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\\\binom{l}{2}}+$ . factors $t$ satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), implying that $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator of $(*)$ exactly  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\\\binom{l}{2}}+\\\\dots\\n$$  \\n\\ntimes. Similarly, $a_{m}$ appears in the denominator of $(*)$ exactly  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\binom{l}{1}}+{\\\\binom{l}{3}}+...\\n$$  \\n\\ntimes. If $m<n$ , then $l\\\\geq1$ and these expressions are equal, so that the $a_{m}$ ’s in the numerator and denominator of $(*)$ cancel each other out. If $m=n$ , then ${\\\\mathit{l}}=0$ , so that $a_{n}$ appears in the numerator once and in the denominator zero times. Therefore,  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\prod_{d|n}b_{d}=\\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{d|n}E_{d}}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{d|n}O_{d}}=a_{n},\\n$$  \\n\\nas desired.  \\n\\nLemma 2. For any integer $\\\\alpha$ that divides some term in $a_{1},a_{2},\\\\dotsb$ , there exists an integer d such that  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\alpha|a_{n}\\\\ \\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\ d|n.\\n$$  \\n\\nProof. Of all the integers $n$ such that $\\\\alpha|a_{n}$ , let $d$ be the smallest.  \\n\\nIf $\\\\alpha|a_{n}$ , then $\\\\alpha|g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}$ . By the minimal definition of $d$ , $g c d(d,n)\\\\geq d$ . But $g c d(d,n)|n$ as well, implying that $g c d(d,n)=d$ . Hence, $d|n$ .  \\n\\nIf $d|n$ , then $g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}=a_{d}$ . Thus, $\\\\displaystyle a_{d}|a_{n}$ . Because $\\\\alpha|a_{d}$ , it follows that $\\\\alpha|a_{n}$ as well. □  \\n\\nLemma 3. For each positive integer $n$ , $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer.  \\n\\nProof. Fix $n$ . Call an integer $d$ a top divisor (resp. a bottom divisor) if $d|n,n/d$ is square-free, and $n/d$ has an even (resp. odd) number of prime factors. By definition, $E_{d}$ is the product of $\\\\mathit{a}_{d}$ over all top divisors $d$ , and $O_{d}$ is the product of $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{d}$ over all bottom divisors $d$ .  \\n\\nFix any prime $p$ . We show that $p$ divides $E_{n}$ at least as many times as it divides $O_{n}$ . To do this, it suffices to show the following for any positive integer $k$ :  \\n\\n(1) The number of top divisors $d$ with $\\\\boldsymbol a_{n/d}$ divisible by $p^{k}$ is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ with divisible by $p^{k}$ . $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$  \\n\\nLet $k$ be any positive integer. If $p^{k}$ divides none of $a_{1},a_{2},\\\\dotsc$ , then (1) holds trivially. Otherwise, by the previous lemma, there exists an integer $d_{0}$ such that  \\n\\n$$\\np^{k}|a_{m}\\\\ \\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\ d_{0}|m.\\n$$  \\n\\nHence, to show (1) it suffices to show:  \\n\\n(2) The number of top divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ , is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ .  \\n\\nIf $d_{0}\\\\nmid n$ , then (2) holds because $d_{0}$ does not divide $n/d$ for any divisor $d$ of $n$ , including top or bottom divisors.  \\n\\nOtherwise, $d_{0}|n$ . For which top and bottom divisors $d$ does $d_{0}$ divide $n/d$ ? Precisely those for which $d$ divides $n/d_{0}$ . If $n/d_{0}$ has $l\\\\geq1$ distinct prime factors, then there are as many top divisors with this property as there are bottom divisors, namely  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\\\binom{l}{2}}+\\\\cdots=2^{l-1}={\\\\binom{l}{1}}+{\\\\binom{l}{3}}+\\\\ldots\\n$$  \\n\\nIf instead $d_{0}=n$ and $\\\\mathit{l}\\\\mathit{\\\\Theta}=0$ , then the top divisor 1 is the only value $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ . In either case, there are at least as many top divisors $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ as there are bottom divisors with the same property. Therefore, (2) holds. This completes the proof. □  \\n\\nTherefore, $a_{n}=\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}b_{d}$ , and $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer for each $n$ .  \\n\\nAlternative solution. (Gabriel Dospinescu) Let us define $b_{1}=a_{1}$ and $b_{n}=\\\\frac{a_{n}}{l c m a_{d}}$ for $n>1$ . Of course, if $d|n$ , then $\\\\displaystyle a_{d}|a_{n}$ and so lcm ad|an and $\\\\begin{array}{l}{l c m a_{d}|a_{n}}\\\\\\\\ {d|n}\\\\\\\\ {d\\\\neq n}\\\\end{array}$ d|n $d\\\\neq n$ $b_{n}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}$ .  \\n\\nNow comes the hard part, proving that $\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}b_{d}=a_{n}$ , which is the same as  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\prod_{\\\\begin{array}{l}{d\\\\left|n}\\\\\\\\ {d\\\\neq n}\\\\end{array}\\\\right.}b_{d}=l c m a_{d}.}\\\\\\\\ {d\\\\neq n}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nWe will prove (1) by strong induction. For $n=1$ it is clear Now, for all $d|n$ , $d\\\\neq n$ , by inductive hypothesis we have  \\n\\n$$\\na_{d}=\\\\prod_{d^{\\\\prime}\\\\mid d\\\\atop d\\\\neq n}b_{d^{\\\\prime}}\\\\mid\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n\\\\atop d\\\\neq n}b_{d},\\n$$  \\n\\nthus $\\\\prod b_{d}$ is a multiple of $l c m a_{d}$ . It remains to prove that $\\\\prod_{\\\\begin{array}{l}{d|n}\\\\\\\\ {d\\\\neq n}\\\\end{array}}b_{d}|\\\\operatorname*{lc}m a_{d}$ $d|n$ $\\\\stackrel{d|n}{d\\\\neq n}$ $d\\\\neq n$  \\n\\nThe essential observation is:  \\n\\nLemma. If $g c d(b_{u},b_{v})>1$ , then $u|v$ or $_{v|u}$  \\n\\nProof. We may assume that $u<v$ . Assume that $u$ does not divide $v$ . Then  \\n\\n$$\\nb_{u}=\\\\frac{a_{u}}{l c m a_{d}}|\\\\frac{a_{u}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}\\\\nonumber\\n$$  \\n\\n(since $g c d(u,v)\\\\neq u$ ) and also  \\n\\n$$\\nb_{v}|\\\\frac{a_{v}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nBut then  \\n\\n$$\\ng c d(b_{u},b_{v})|g c d\\\\left(\\\\frac{a_{u}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}},\\\\frac{a_{v}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{g c d(a_{u},a_{v})}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nNow, let $p$ be a prime number and let $i_{1}<i_{2}<\\\\dots<i_{k}$ such that $i_{q}|n$ , $i_{q}\\\\neq n$ for all $q$ and $b_{i_{q}}$ has the exponent of $p$ equal to $e_{q}\\\\geq1$ and any $b_{d}$ with $d|n$ , $d\\\\neq n$ , $d\\\\neq i_{q}$ for all $q$ is not a multiple of $p$ . From the lemma we find $i_{1}|i_{2}|\\\\dots|i_{k}$ .

The function $f_{i}(a,b)$ is symmetric for any odd $i$ .  \\n\\nProof. We will prove also that $f_{i}(a,b)$ is symmetric function multiplied by $a$ . Now, we are to prove that $f_{2k-1}(a,b)$ is symmetric and $f_{2k-2}(a,b)=$ $a g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ , where $g_{2k-2}$ is symmetric too, for any positive integer $k$ . Proceed by induction on $k$ . For $k=1$ we have $f_{1}(a,b)=1$ and $g_{0}(a,b)=0$ .  \\n\\nSuppose that $f_{2k-1}(a,b)$ is symmetric and $f_{2k-2}(a,b)=a g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ where $g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ is symmetric too.

Proceed by induction on $k$ . For $k=1$ this statement is true. Let $x_{m}|x_{k m}$ . Then from (1) and (2) putting $r=k m$ and $i=m$ , we obtain the following. If $k m$ is even, then  \\n\\n$$\\nx_{m(k+1)}\\\\equiv f_{m}(a,b)x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv x_{m}x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv0{\\\\pmod{x_{m}}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nFor $k m$ odd $m$ is odd too and $f_{m}(a,b)=f_{m}(b,a)$ . Hence, we have  \\n\\n$$\\nx_{m(k+1)}\\\\equiv f_{m}(b,a)x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv f_{m}(a,b)x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv x_{m}x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv0{\\\\pmod{x_{m}}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nSo, for each nonnegative integers $k,m\\\\ x_{m}|x_{k m}$ .  \\n\\nSince the product $x_{n+1}x_{n+2}\\\\ldots x_{n+m}$ has $m$ terms, one of their indices is divisible by $m$ and another’s index is divisible by $m-1$ . Thus both $x_{m}$ and $x_{m-1}$ divide the product. If we can show that $x_{m}$ is relatively prime to $x_{m-1}$ , we would be done. We will prove this by induction. For the base case, $x_{0}$ is relatively prime to $x_{1}$ . Now, $x_{2n}=a x_{2n-1}-x_{2n-2}$ . Any prime factor common to $x_{2n}$ and $x_{2n-1}$ must also divide $x_{2n-2}$ , but because $x_{2n-2}$ is relatively prime to $x_{2n-1}$ , there is no such prime factor. A similar argument holds for $x_{2n+1}$ because $x_{2n+1}=b x_{2n}-x_{2n-1}$ . Thus $x_{m}x_{m-1}|(x_{n+1}x_{n+2}\\\\dots x_{n+m})$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Let $m$ be a positive integer.

The ”if” direction of the claim is easily proven by induction on $n$ ; we prove the ”only if” direction by contradiction. Suppose, on the contrary, that there exist pairs satisfying the equation but not of the described form; let $(a,b)$ be such a pair with minimal sum $a+b$ . We claim that $(c,a)=(m^{2}a-b,a)$ is another such a pair but with smaller sum $c+a$ , which leads to a contradiction.  \\n\\n(a) $a=0$ . Then $(a,b)=(0,m)=(a_{0},a_{1})$ , a contradiction. (b) $a=m$ . Then $(a,b)=(m,m^{3})=(a_{1},a_{2})$ , a contradiction. (c) $a=1$ . Then $b\\\\geq1=1$ and $(b+1)|(b^{2}+1)$ ; but $(b+1)|(b^{2}-1)$ , thus $(b+1)|[(b^{2}+1)-(b^{2}-1)]=2$ . We have $b=1$ , thus $m=1$ and $(a,b)=(1,1)=(a_{1},a_{2})$ , a contradiction.  \\n\\n(d) $2\\\\leq a<m$ .

We have $b c=a^{2}-m^{2}>0$ ; since $b\\\\geq0$ , $c>0$ . Since $a>0$ and $c>0$ , $a c+1>0$ , we have  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\frac{c^{2}+a^{2}}{c a+1}}=m^{2}.\\n$$  \\n\\nSince $c>0$ , $b\\\\geq a$ and $b c=a^{2}-m^{2}<a^{2}$ , we have $c<a$ .
