Find all odd positive integers n greater than 1 such that for any relatively prime divisors a and $b$ of $n$ , the number $a+b-1$ is also a divisor of $n$ .  \\n\\n(2001 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. We will call a number ”good” if it satisfies the given conditions. It is not difficult to see that all prime powers are good. Suppose $n$ is a good number that has at least two distinct prime factors. Let $n=p^{r}s$ , where $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $n$ and $s$ is not divisible by $p$ . Because $n$ is good, $p+s-1$ must divide $n$ . For any prime $q$ dividing $s$ , $s<p+s-1<s+q$ , so $q$ does not divide $p+s-1$ . Therefore, the only prime factor of $p+s-1$ is $p$ . Then $s=p^{c}-p+1$ for some $c>1$ . Because $p^{c}$ must also divide $n$ , $p^{c}+s-1=2p^{c}-p$ divides $n$ . Because $2p^{c-1}-1$ has no factors of $p$ , it must divide $s$ . But a simple computation shows that $\\\\frac{p-1}{2}<\\\\frac{p^{c}-p+1}{2p^{c-1}-1}<\\\\frac{p+1}{2}$ , therefore $2p^{c-1}-1$ cannot divide $s$ .  \\n\\n', 'Golden': 'Problem. Find the smallest positive integer $K$ such that every $K$ -element subset of $\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,50\\\\}$ contains two distinct elements $a,b$ such that $a+b$ divides ab.  \\n\\n(1996 Chinese Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. The minimal value is $k=39$ . Suppose $a,b\\\\in S$ are such that $a+b$ divides $a b$ . Let $c=g c d(a,b)$ , and put $a=c a_{1}$ , $b=c b_{1}$ , so that $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are relatively prime. Then $c(a_{1}+b_{1})$ divides $c^{2}a_{1}b_{1}$ , so $a_{1}+b_{1}$ divides $c a_{1}b_{1}$ . Since $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ have no common factor, neither do $a_{1}$ and $a_{1}+b_{1}$ , or $b_{1}$ and $a_{1}+b_{1}$ . In short, $a_{1}+b_{1}$ divides $c$ .  \\n\\nSince $S\\\\subseteq\\\\{1,\\\\dots,50\\\\}$ , we have $a+b\\\\leq99$ , so $c(a_{1}+b_{1})\\\\leq99$ , which implies $a_{1}+b_{1}\\\\leq9$ ; on the other hand, of course $a_{1}+b_{1}\\\\geq3$ .

Suppose that the claim is false. Then for each $i=1,2,\\\\ldots,n$ there exists an integer $x_{i}$ such that $P(x_{i})$ is not divisible by $a_{i}$ . Hence, there is a prime power $p_{i}^{k_{i}}$ that divides $a_{i}$ and does not divide $P(x_{i})$ . Some of the powers $p_{1}^{k_{1}},p_{2}^{k_{2}},\\\\ldots,p_{n}^{k_{n}}$ may have the same base.

By the definition of pjk , the number P (xj) is never divisible by $p_{j}^{k_{j}}$ , $j=1,2,\\\\dots,m$ . Thus, for the solution $x$ given by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $P(x)$ is not divisible by any of the powers $p_{j}^{k_{j}}$ .
