Show that if $\\\\varphi(n)$ divides $n-1$ and $\\\\psi(n)\\\\leq3$ , then n is prime.  \\n\\n(1998 Korean Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. Note that for prime $p$ , if $p^{2}|n$ then $p|\\\\varphi(n)$ but $p\\\\nmid n\\\\to1$ , contradiction. So we need only show that $n\\\\not=p q$ , $n\\\\ \\\\ne\\\\ p q r$ for primes $p<q<r$ .  \\n\\nFirst assume $n=p q$ , so $(p-1)(q-1)|p q-1$ . Note that $q\\\\geq3$ implies that the left side is even, so the right is too and $p,q$ are odd. But if $p=3$ , $q=5$ then  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{p q-1}{(p-1)(q-1)}<2;\\n$$  \\n\\nthe left side is decreasing in each variable and always $>1$ so it cannot be an integer, contradiction.  \\n\\nNow let $n=p q r$ . As before $p,q,r$ are odd; if $p=3$ , $q=7$ , and $r=11$ then  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{p q r-1}{(p-1)(q-1)(r-1)}<2\\n$$  \\n\\nand again the left side is decreasing and $>1$ ; this eliminates all cases except where $p=3$ , $q=5$ . Then for $r=7$ we have  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{p q r-1}{(p-1)(q-1)(r-1)}<3\\n$$  \\n\\nso the only integer value ever attainable is 2. Note that $(15r-1)/8(r-1)=2$ gives $r=15$ which is not a prime and we have eliminated all cases.  \\n\\nRemarks. 1) The problem is a direct consequence of Problem 1.1.16.  \\n\\n2) A long stonaling conjecture due to Lehmer asserts that if $\\\\varphi(n)|n-1$ , then $n$ is a prime. This has been proved so far for $\\\\psi(n)\\\\leq14$ . The proofs are very long and computational and no further progress has been made on this conjecture.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Show that the equation $\\\\varphi(n)=\\\\tau(n)$ has only the solutions $n=1,3,8,10,18,24,30$ .  \\n\\nSolution. We check directly that the listed integers satisfy the equation and there are no others $\\\\leq30$ with this property. We will prove that for $n\\\\geq31$ , $\\\\varphi(n)>\\\\tau(n)$ . For this we consider the multiplicative function $f(n)={\\\\frac{\\\\varphi(n)}{\\\\tau(n)}}$ . If $n$ is a prime, we have $f(n)={\\\\frac{n-1}{2}}$ , hence $f$ increases on the set of primes.  \\n\\nFor a prime $p$ , define $S_{p}=\\\\{p^{\\\\alpha}|\\\\alpha\\\\geq1\\\\}$ .

Using the fact that $\\\\operatorname*{min}_{p,\\\\alpha}f(p^{\\\\alpha})=f(2)={\\\\frac{1}{2}}$ , it follows that in order to solve the given equation we need to consider the integers $p^{\\\\alpha}$ with $f(p^{\\\\alpha})\\\\leq2$ . These are 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 16, whose prime factors are only 2, 3, or 5 and the conclusion follows.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Let $n>6$ be an integer and $a_{1},a_{2},\\\\ldots,a_{k}$ be all positive integers less than $n$ and relatively prime to $n$ .

It is given that the reduced system of residues modn chosen from the set $\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,n-1\\\\}$ is an arithmetic progression. We write it as an increasing sequence $1=a_{1}<a_{2}<\\\\cdots<a_{k}=n-1$ .  \\n\\nFor a prime number $n$ the reduced system of residues is the sequence $1<2<\\\\cdots<n-1$ and it is an arithmetic progression with ratio 1. If $n=2^{l}$ the reduced system of residues is $1<3<5<\\\\cdots<2^{l}-1$ and it is an arithmetic progression with ratio 2. The problem asks to prove that only these cases can appear.  \\n\\nLet $a_{2}$ be the second member of the progression. Because $a_{2}>1$ is the least positive number relatively prime to $n$ , it is a prime number, say $p$ and $p>3$ . Then, the ratio of the progression is $a_{2}\\\\:-\\\\:a_{1}=p\\\\:-\\\\:1$ and $a_{k}=n-1=1+(k-1)(p-1)$ . We obtain a ”key” formula:  \\n\\n$$\\nn-2=(k-1)(p-1).\\n$$  \\n\\nRemembering the choice of $p$ , $n$ is divisible by 3 and then $n-2\\\\equiv1$ (mod 3). Thus, by the key formula we cannot have $p\\\\equiv1$ (mod 3). Since $p>3$ we have $p\\\\equiv2$ (mod 3). Then $a_{3}=1+2(p-1)\\\\equiv0$ (mod 3) and this contradicts the supposition that $a_{3}$ and $n$ are relatively prime numbers.  \\n']"

Now, we need another observation: the sum of digits of a number $A$ when written in binary is at most the number of digits of $A$ in base 2, which is $1+\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\log_{2}A\\\\right\\\\rfloor$ (this follows from the fact that $2^{k-1}\\\\leq A<2^{k}$ , where $k$ is the number of digits of $A$ in base 2). So, we have the estimations $a+b<n+S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)\\\\leq$ $n+2+\\\\log_{2}{a b}\\\\leq n+2+2\\\\log_{2}{n}$ (since we have of course $a,b\\\\le n$ ).

Let us write $n_{k}=2^{x}\\\\cdot5^{y}$ . First of all, suppose that $x,y$ are positive. Thus,  \\n\\n$$\\n(n_{1}+1)\\\\ldots(n_{k}-1)n_{k}+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+(n_{k-1}+1)\\\\ldots(n_{k}-1)n_{k}+1\\n$$  \\n\\nis relatively prime with 10 and it follows that $e_{2}(n_{k})=e_{5}(n_{k})$ . This implies of course that $\\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n_{k}}{2^{j}}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n_{k}}{5^{j}}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor$ for all $j$ (because we clearly have $\\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n_{k}}{2^{j}}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor>$ $\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{n_{k}}{5^{j}}\\\\rfloor)$ and so $n_{k}\\\\le3$ . A verification by hand shows that there is no solution in this case.  \\n\\nNext, suppose that $y=0$ .

Again this implies $e_{2}(n_{k})=e_{5}(n_{k})$ and we have seen that this gives no solution. So, actually $x=0$ . A crucial observation is that if $n_{k}>n_{k-1}+1$ , then  \\n\\n$$\\n(n_{1}+1)\\\\ldots(n_{k}-1)n_{k}+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+(n_{k-1}+1)\\\\ldots(n_{k}-1)n_{k}+1\\n$$  \\n\\nis again odd and thus we find again that $e_{2}(n_{k})=n\\\\leq e_{5}(n_{k})$ , impossible. So, $n_{k}=n_{k-1}+1$ . But then, taking into account that $n_{k}$ is a power of 5, we deduce that  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\cdot\\\\cdot(n_{k}-1)n_{k}+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+(n_{k-1}+1)\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot(n_{k}-1)n_{k}+\\\\cdot\\n$$  \\n\\nis congruent to 2 modulo 4 and thus $e_{2}(n_{k})=n+1\\\\leq e_{5}(n_{k})+1$ . It follows that $\\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n_{k}}{2}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor\\\\leq1+\\\\left\\\\lfloor{\\\\frac{n_{k}}{5}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor$ and thus $n_{k}\\\\le6$ . Since $n_{k}$ is a power of 5, we find that $n_{k}=5$ , $n_{k-1}=$ and a quick research of all possibilities shows that there are no solutions.  \\n']"

Indeed, exactly half of the divisors of $n^{2}+1$ are less than $n$ , and all are odd, so there are at most $2(n/2)$ in all.  \\n\\nNow if $\\\\tau(n^{2}+1)$ becomes strictly monotonic for $n\\\\geq N$ , then  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tau((n+1)^{2}+1)\\\\geq\\\\tau(n^{2}+1)+2\\n$$  \\n\\nfor $n\\\\geq N$ (since $\\\\tau(k)$ is even for $k$ not a perfect square). Thus  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tau(n^{2}+1)\\\\geq\\\\tau(N^{2}+1)+2(n-N)\\n$$  \\n\\nwhich exceeds $n$ for large, contradiction.  \\n\\n# Proposed problems  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Does there exist a positive integer such that the product of its proper divisors ends with exactly 2001 zeroes?  \\n\\n# (2001 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. Yes. Given an integer $n$ with $\\\\tau(n)$ is equal to  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}d\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}(n/d)\\\\right)}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}d(n/d)}=\\\\sqrt{n^{\\\\tau(n)}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nThus, the product of all proper positive divisors of $n$ equals  \\n\\n$$\\nn^{{\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\tau(n)-1}.\\n$$  \\n\\nIf $n=\\\\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}^{q_{i}}$ with the $p_{i}$ ’s distinct primes and the $q_{i}$ ’s positive integers, then $\\\\tau(n)=\\\\prod_{i=1}^{k}(q_{i}+1)$ . Hence, if we set $n=2^{1}\\\\cdot5^{1}\\\\cdot7^{6}\\\\cdot11^{10}\\\\cdot13^{12}$ , then  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\tau(n)-1={\\\\frac{1}{2}}(2\\\\cdot2\\\\cdot7\\\\cdot11\\\\cdot13)-1=2001.\\n$$  \\n\\nThus, the product of the proper divisors of $n$ is equal to $2^{2001}\\\\cdot5^{2001}$ 76·2001 · 1110·2001 · 1312·2001, an integer ending in exactly 2001 zeroes.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Prove that the number of divisors of the form $4k+1$ of each positive integer is not less than the number of its divisors of the form $4k+3$ .  \\n\\nSolution. To solve the problem, consider the function  \\n\\n$$\\nf(n)=\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{c l l}{{0,}}&{{\\\\mathrm{if}}}&{{n{\\\\mathrm{~is~even}}}}\\\\\\\\ {{1,}}&{{\\\\mathrm{if}}}&{{n\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{4}}}}\\\\\\\\ {{-1,}}&{{\\\\mathrm{if}}}&{{n\\\\equiv3{\\\\pmod{4}}.}}\\\\end{array}\\\\right.\\n$$  \\n\\nIt follows directly from this definition that $f(n)$ is multiplicative. Now we apply (1). The even divisors of $n$ do not influence its left-hand side. Each divisor of the form $4k+1$ contributes a 1, and each divisor of the form $4k+3$ contributes $a-1$ . Consequently, it suffices to prove that the summation function of $f,\\\\sum_{d\\\\mid n}f(d)$ is nonnegative for each positive integer $n$ .  \\n\\nTake any prime divisor $p_{i}$ of $n$ . If $p_{i}\\\\equiv1$ (mod 4), then the same congruence holds for all powers of $p_{i}$ , so the $\\\\textit{\\\\textbf{\\\\i}}$ th factor in the right-hand side of (1) is positive. If $p_{i}$ is congruent to 3 modulo 4, then so are its odd powers while the even powers are congruent to 1 modulo 4. In this case the $i$ th factor in the right-hand side has the form $1-1+1-1+...$ , and it equals $^{1}$ or 0 according as $\\\\alpha_{i}$ is even or odd. Summing up, we conclude that the sum in question is nonnegative.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Let $d_{1},d_{2},\\\\ldots,d_{l}$ be all positive divisors of a positive integer.

Is it possible to make a sequence of moves after which all of the numbers are colored white?  \\n\\n(1999 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. It is possible. We begin by proving the following lemma:  \\n\\nLemma. Given a set $S$ of positive integers, there is a subset $T\\\\subseteq S$ such that every element of $S$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ .  \\n\\nProof. We prove the claim by induction on $|S|$ , the number of elements in $S$ . If $|S|=1$ then let $T=S$ .  \\n\\nIf $|S|>1$ , then let $\\\\alpha$ be the smallest element of $S$ . Consider the set $S^{\\\\prime}=S\\\\backslash\\\\{a\\\\}$ , the set of the largest $|S|-1$ elements in $S$ . By induction there is a subset $T^{\\\\prime}\\\\subseteq S^{\\\\prime}$ such that every element in $S^{\\\\prime}$ divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\\\prime}$ .  \\n\\nIf $a$ also divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\\\prime}$ , then the set $T=T^{\\\\prime}$ suffices. Otherwise, consider the set ${\\\\cal T}={\\\\cal T}^{\\\\prime}\\\\cup\\\\{a\\\\}$ . $a$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ . Every other element in $T$ is bigger than $a$ and can’t divide it, but divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\\\prime}=T\\\\backslash\\\\{a\\\\}$ . Hence $T$ suffices, completing the induction and the proof of the lemma. □  \\n\\nNow, write each number $n>1$ in its prime factorization  \\n\\n$$\\nn=p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot p_{k}^{a_{k}},\\n$$  \\n\\nwhere the $p_{i}$ are distinct primes and the $a_{i}$ ate positive integers. Notice that the color of $n$ will always be the same as the color of $P(n)=p_{1}p_{2}\\\\ldots p_{k}$ .  \\n\\nApply the lemma to the set $S$ consisting in all $P(i)$ for $\\\\begin{array}{r l}{i}&{{}=}\\\\end{array}$ $2,3,\\\\ldots,1000000$ to find a subset $T\\\\subset S$ such that every element of $S$  \\n\\ndivides an odd number of elements in $T$ . For each $q\\\\in S$ , let $t(q)$ equal the   \\nnumber of elements in $T$ that divides, and let $u(q)$ equal the number of $q$   \\nprimes dividing $q$ .  \\n\\nSelect all the numbers in $T$ , and consider how the color of a number $n>1$ changes. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of elements in $T$ not relatively prime to $n$ equals  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{q|P(n),q>1}(-1)^{u(q)+1}t(q).\\n$$  \\n\\nIn particular, if $q|P(n)$ is divisible by exactly $m>0$ primes, then it is counted ${\\\\binom{m}{1}}-{\\\\binom{m}{2}}+{\\\\binom{m}{3}}-\\\\cdots=1$ time in the sum. (For example, if $n\\\\ =\\\\ 6$ then the number of elements in $T$ divisible by 2 or 3 equals $t(2)+t(3)-t(6)$ .)  \\n\\nBy the definition of $T$ , each of the values $t(q)$ is odd. Because there are $2^{k}-1$ divisors $q>1$ of $P(n)$ , the above quantity is the sum of $2^{k}-1$ odd numbers and is odd itself. Therefore after selecting $T$ , every number $n>1$ will switch color an odd number of times and will turn white.  \\n\\nFinally, select 1 to turn 1 white to complete the process.  \\n\\nNote. In fact, a slight modification of the above proof shows that $T$ is unique. With some work, this stronger result implies that there is in essence exactly one way to make all the numbers white up to trivial manipulations.  \\n\\nSecond solution. Yes, it is possible. We prove a more general statement, where we replace 1000000 in the problem by some arbitrary positive integer $m$ . We also focus on the numbers divisible by just a few primes instead of all the primes.  \\n\\nLemma. For a finite set of distinct primes $S~=~\\\\{p1,p_{2},...,p_{n}\\\\}$ , let $Q_{m}(S)$ be the set of numbers between $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{Z}}$ and $m$ divisible only by primes in $S$ . The elements of $Q_{m}(S)$ can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number in $Q_{m}(S)$ and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Then it is possible to reverse the coloring of $Q_{m}(S)$ by selecting several numbers in a subset $R_{m}(S)\\\\subseteq Q_{m}(S)$ .  \\n\\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction on $n$ . If $n=1$ , then selecting $p_{1}$ suffices. Now suppose $n>1$ , and assume without loss of generality that the numbers are all black to start with.  \\n\\nLet $T=\\\\{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n-1}\\\\}$ , and define $t$ to be the largest integer such that $t p_{n}\\\\leq m$ . We can assume $t\\\\geq1$ because otherwise we could ignore $p_{n}$ and just use the smaller set $T$ , and we’d be done by our induction hypothesis.  \\n\\nNow select the numbers in $R_{m}(T),R_{t}(T)$ , and $p_{n}R_{t}(T)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\{p_{n}x|\\\\ x\\\\ \\\\in$ $R_{t}(T)\\\\}$ , and consider the effect of this action on a number $y$ :  \\n\\n$y$ is not a multiple of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. If selecting $x\\\\in R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color, selecting $x p_{n}$ will change it back so that $y$ will become white.   \\n$y$ is a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ and $R_{t}(T)$ has no effect on $y$ , but each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.   \\n$p_{n}|y$ but $y$ is not a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. Because $y\\\\neq p_{n}^{i}$ , it is divisible by some prime in $T$ so selecting the numbers in $R_{t}(T)$ makes $y$ black again. Finally, each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.  \\n\\nTherefore, all the multiples of $p_{n}$ are the same color (black if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is even, white if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is odd), while all the other numbers in $Q_{m}(S)$ are white. If the multiples of $p_{n}$ are still black, we can select $p_{n}$ to make them white, and we are done. $\\\\boxed{\\\\begin{array}{r l}\\\\end{array}}$  \\n\\nWe now return to the original problem. Set $m=1000000$ , and let $S$ be the set of all primes under 1000000. From the lemma, we can select numbers between 2 and 1000000 so that all the numbers $2,3,\\\\ldots,1000000$ are white.

Because 3 does not divide 17, 3 cannot divide $y$ either. Hence applying our result from the previous paragraph twice, once with $(a,m)=(y,n)$ and once with $(a,m)=(y+3^{n-1},n)$ , we find that $3^{n+1}$ must divide either $(y+3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ or $(y+2\\\\cdot3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ .  \\n\\nHence there exists a natural number $x^{\\\\prime}$ not divisible by 3 such that $3^{n+1}|{x^{\\\\prime}}^{3}+17$ . If $3^{n+2}$ does not divide ${x^{\\\\prime}}^{3}+17$ , we are done. Otherwise, we claim the number $x=x^{\\\\prime}+3^{n}$ suffices. Because $x=x^{\\\\prime}+3^{n-1}+3^{n-1}+3^{n-1}$ , the result from previous the paragraphs tells us that $x^{3}\\\\equiv{x^{\\\\prime}}^{3}+3^{n}+$ $3^{n}+3^{n}\\\\equiv x^{\\\\prime3}$ (mod $3^{n+1}$ ).

Consider the triple $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})=(x_{0},x_{0}+$ $y_{0}-2z_{0},z_{0}-x_{0}\\\\big)$ , so that $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})=(x_{1},x_{1}+y_{1}+2z_{1},x_{1}+z_{1})$ .  \\n\\nFirst, using the fact that $x_{0}y_{0}=z_{0}^{2}+1$ , it is easy to check that $(x,y,z)=$ $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ satisfies $x y=z^{2}+1$ .  \\n\\nSecond, we claim that $x_{1},y_{1},z_{1}>0$ .

We prove this by induction on the number of digits of $n$ . First, we know that for all one-digit $n$ , $P(n)=n+1$ . Now suppose that $P(n)\\\\leq n+1$ for all $m$ -digit numbers $n$ . Any $(m+1)$ -digit number $n$ is of the form $10s{+t}$ , where $s$ is an $m$ -digit number. Then  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{c}{{t(P(s)-1)\\\\le9((s+1)-1)}}\\\\\\\\ {{\\\\qquadt P(s)-10s-t\\\\le-s}}\\\\\\\\ {{\\\\qquadP(s)(t+1)-10s-t\\\\le P(s)-s}}\\\\\\\\ {{\\\\qquadP(10s+t)-(10s+t)\\\\le P(s)-s\\\\le1}}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\ncompleting the inductive step. Thus, $P(n)\\\\leq n+1$ for all $n$ .  \\n\\nIf $P(n)=n$ , then $n$ has more than one digit and we may write $n=10s{+}t$ . From the first statement, we have $P(s)\\\\geq s+1$ . From the second one, we have $P(s)\\\\leq s+1$ . Thus, $P(s)=s+1$ . Hence,  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{c}{{(t+1)P(s)=P(10s+t)=10s+t}}\\\\\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\\\\\ {{(t+1)(s+1)=10s+t}}\\\\\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\\\\\ {{1=(9-t)s.}}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nThis is possible if $t=8$ and $s=1$ , so the only possible $n$ such that $P(n)=n$ is 18. Indeed, $P(18)=(1+1)(8+1)=18$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

Let $e$ be the highest exponent such that $p^{e}$ divides $b$ , and let $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ be the corresponding highest exponents for $a$ and $c$ , respectively. Because $b^{2}=a c$ , we have $2e\\\\mathrm{~=~}e_{1}+e_{2}$ .

A wobbly number is a positive integer whose digits in base 10 are alternately non-zero and zero, the units digit being non-zero. Determine all positive integers which do not divide any wobbly number.  \\n\\n( $35^{t h}$ IMO Shortlist)  \\n\\nSolution. If $n$ is a multiple of 10, then the last digit of any multiple of $n$ is $0$ . Hence it is not wobbly. If $n$ is a multiple of 25, then the last two digits of any multiple of $n$ are 25, 50, 75 or 00. Hence it is not wobbly. We now prove that these are the only numbers not dividing any wobbly number.  \\n\\nWe first consider odd numbers $m$ not divisible by 5. Then $g c d(m,10)=1$ , and we have $g c d((10^{k}-1)m,10)=1$ , for any $k\\\\geq1$ .

In particular, $x_{2}$ is a wobbly multiple of $m$ . If $m$ is divisible by 5, then $5x_{2}$ is a wobbly multiple of $m$ .  \\n\\nNext, we consider powers of 2. We prove by induction on $t$ that $2^{2t+1}$ has a wobbly multiple $w_{t}$ with precisely $t$ non-zero digits. For $t=1$ , take $w_{1}=8$ . Suppose $w_{t}$ exists for some $t\\\\geq1$ . Then $w_{t}=2^{2t+1}d$ for some $d$ . Let $w_{t+1}=$ $10^{2t}c+w_{t}$ where $c\\\\in\\\\{1,2,3,...,9\\\\}$ is to be chosen later. Clearly, $w_{t+1}$ is wobbly, and has precisely $t+1$ non-zero digits. Since $w_{t+1}+2^{2t}(5^{2t}c+2d)$ , it is divisible by $2^{2t+3}$ if and only if $5^{2t}c+2d\\\\equiv0$ (mod 8) or $c\\\\equiv6d$ (mod 8). We can always choose $c$ to be one of 8, $6$ , 4 and 2 in order to satisfy this congruence. Thus the inductive argument is completed.

What is the smallest multiple of 99 whose digits sum to 99 and which begins and ends with 97?  \\n\\n(1997 Rio Platense Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. We refer to the digits of the number besides the two 97s as interior digits; the sum of these digits is $99-2(9+7)=67$ . Since each digit is at most 9, there are at least 8 such digits.  \\n\\nNote that the sum of digits being 99 forces the number to be divisible by 9; thus it suffices to ensure that the number be divisible by 11, which is to say, the alternating sum of digits must be divisible by 11.  \\n\\nSuppose the number has exactly 8 interior digits. If $a$ is the sum of the odd interior places and $b$ the sum of the even places, we have $a+b=67$ and $a-b\\\\equiv-3$ (mod 11). Since $a-b$ must also be odd, we have $a-b\\\\ge7$ or $a-b\\\\leq-15$ , and so either $a\\\\geq37$ or $b\\\\geq41$ , contradicting the fact that $a$ and $b$ are each the sum of four digits.  \\n\\nNow suppose the number has 9 interior digits. In this case, $a-b\\\\equiv0$ (mod 11), so $a-b\\\\geq11$ or $a-b\\\\leq-11$ . In the latter case, $b\\\\geq39$ , again a contradiction, but in the former case, we have $a\\\\geq39$ , which is possible because $a$ is now the sum of five digits. To minimize the original number, we take the odd digits to be 3, 9, 9, 9, 9 and the even digits to be 1, 9, 9, 9, making the minimal number 9731999999997.  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

The answer is yes. It is easier to find $a+b$ , $b+c$ , $c+a$ instead. Since $a+b+c$ is an integer, their sum $2(a+b+c)$ must be even; since $a,b,c$ are positive, they must satisfy the triangle inequality.

When $n=8$ , the sum of the digits of $f(8)=201$ is 3. Suppose that there was some $m$ such that $f(m)$ had a smaller sum of digits. Then the last digit of $f(m)$ must be either $0$ , $^{1}$ , or 2. Because $f(n)\\\\equiv1$ (mod 2) for all $n$ , $f(m)$ must have units digit 1.  \\n\\nBecause $f(n)$ can never equal 1, this means we must have $3m^{2}+m+1=$ $10^{k}+1$ for some positive integer $k$ , and $m(3m+1)=10^{k}$ . Because $m$ and $3m+1$ are relatively prime, and $m<3m+1$ , we must either have $(m,3m+1)=(1,10^{k})$ – which is impossible – or $(m,3m+1)=(2^{k},5^{k})$ .

For every $d>0$ there exists a $d$ -digit number that contains only ones and twos in its decimal expansion and is a multiple of $2^{d}$ .  \\n\\nProof. Exactly in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 1.7.1 one can prove that any two $d$ -digit numbers which have only ones and twos give different residues mod $2^{d}$ . Since there are $2^{d}$ such numbers, one of them is a multiple of $2^{d}$ . □  \\n\\nLemma 2. For each $k>2$ there exists $d\\\\leq k$ such that the following inequality holds: $k+d\\\\leq2^{d}\\\\leq9k-8d$ .  \\n\\nProof. For $3\\\\le k\\\\le5$ , $d=3$ satisfies the inequalities. For $5\\\\leq k\\\\leq10$ , $d=4$ satisfies the inequalities. We will show that $d=\\\\lfloor\\\\log_{2}4k\\\\rfloor$ satisfies for all $k>10$ . If $k>3$ , then $\\\\log_{2}{4k}\\\\leq2^{k}$ , so $d<k$ . Additionally, $k+d\\\\leq2k\\\\leq$ $2^{d}$ . If $k>10$ , then $16k^{2}\\\\leq2^{k}$ , so $4k\\\\leq2^{k/2}\\\\leq2^{5k/8}$ , $d\\\\leq\\\\log_{2}{4k}\\\\leq\\\\frac{5}{8}n$ n and $8k-8d\\\\geq4k\\\\geq2^{d}$ . $\\\\sqsubset$  \\n\\nNow, return to the original problem. For $k=1$ , $n=1$ has the desired property. For $k=2$ , $n=12$ has the desired property. Now, for each $k>2$ we have some number $d$ satisfying the condition Lemma 2. Consider a $k$ -digit integer $n$ such that the last $d$ digits of $n$ have the property described in the first Lemma. We can choose each of the other digits of $n$ to be any number between zero and nine. We know that the sum of the last $d$ digits of $n$ is between $d$ and $2d$ , and we can choose the sum of the other $k-d$ digits to be any number between $k-d$ and $9(k-d)$ . Since $k-d+2d\\\\leq2^{d}\\\\leq9(k-d)+d$ , we can choose the other digits such that the sum of the digits of $n$ is $2^{d}$ . This completes the proof because $n$ is a multiple of $2^{d}$ .  \\n\\nRemark. A number divisible by the sum of its digits is called a Niven1 number. It has been proved recently that the number of Niven numbers smaller than $x$ is $\\\\left(\\\\frac{14}{27}\\\\log{10}+o(1)\\\\right)\\\\frac{x}{\\\\log{x}}$ x . The courageous reader may try to prove that there are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive numbers which are not Niven numbers (which is easily implied by the above result; yet there is an elementary proof of the last assertion). For more details one can read the article ”Large and small gaps between consecutive Niven numbers”, Journal of Integer Sequences, Vol.6(2003), by J.-M. Koninck and N. Doyon.  \\n']"

Of course, we may assume that $a\\\\leq b$ . Since $a^{2}(b^{2}+1)=(c-$ $b)(c+b)$ and $b^{2}+1$ is a prime, we have $b^{2}+1|c-b$ or $b^{2}+1|c+b$ . If $b^{2}+1|c-b$ , then $a^{2}\\\\geq c+b\\\\geq b^{2}+2b+1$ , impossible since $a\\\\leq b$ . So there is $k$ such that $c+b=k(b^{2}+1)$ and $a^{2}=k(b^{2}+1)-2b$ .

Of course, there is $1\\\\leq i\\\\leq12$ such that $d_{i}=d_{1}+d_{2}+d_{4}$ . Since $d_{i}>d_{4}$ , we have $i\\\\geq5$ . Also, observe that $d_{j}d_{13-j}=m$ for all $j$ and since $d_{i}d_{8}=d_{d_{4}-1}\\\\leq n$ , we must have $i\\\\leq5$ , thus $i=5$ and $d_{1}+d_{2}+d_{4}=d_{5}$ . Also, $d_{d_{4}-1}=d_{5}d_{8}=n=d_{12}$ , thus $d_{4}=13$ and $d_{5}=14+d_{2}$ . Of course, $d_{2}$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$ and since $d_{4}=13$ , we can only have $d_{2}\\\\in\\\\{2,3,5,7,11\\\\}$ . Also, since $n$ has 12 divisors, it has at most 3 prime divisors. If $d_{2}=2$ then $d_{5}=16$ and then 4 and 8 are divisors of $n$ , smaller than $d_{4}~=~13$ , impossible. A similar argument shows that $d_{2}~=~3$ and $d_{5}=17$ .

We will call a number ”good” if it satisfies the given conditions. It is not difficult to see that all prime powers are good. Suppose $n$ is a good number that has at least two distinct prime factors. Let $n=p^{r}s$ , where $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $n$ and $s$ is not divisible by $p$ . Because $n$ is good, $p+s-1$ must divide $n$ . For any prime $q$ dividing $s$ , $s<p+s-1<s+q$ , so $q$ does not divide $p+s-1$ . Therefore, the only prime factor of $p+s-1$ is $p$ . Then $s=p^{c}-p+1$ for some $c>1$ . Because $p^{c}$ must also divide $n$ , $p^{c}+s-1=2p^{c}-p$ divides $n$ . Because $2p^{c-1}-1$ has no factors of $p$ , it must divide $s$ . But a simple computation shows that $\\\\frac{p-1}{2}<\\\\frac{p^{c}-p+1}{2p^{c-1}-1}<\\\\frac{p+1}{2}$ , therefore $2p^{c-1}-1$ cannot divide $s$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

At least one of six consecutive numbers is divisible by 5. From the given condition it follows that two numbers must be divisible by 5. These two numbers are necessarily $n$ and $n+5$ . Therefore $n$ and $n+5$ are in distinct subsets. Since $n(n+1)>n+5$ , it follows that a required partition cannot be considered with subsets of different cardinality. Thus each subset must contain three numbers. The following possibilities have to be considered:  \\n\\na) $\\\\{n,n+2,n+4\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\{n+1,n+3,n+5\\\\}$ b) $\\\\{n,n+3,n+4\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\{n+1,n+2,n+5\\\\}.$ In case a), $n<n+1$ , $n+2<n+3$ and $n+4<n+5$ .

Note that $3\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot7\\\\cdot19=1995$ . If the chosen divisors include one divisible by 19 and another not divisible by 19, the quotient of the two has numerator divisible by 19, solving the problem since $n\\\\leq16$ . If this is not the case, either all divisors are or divisible by 19 or none of them has this property, and in particular $n\\\\leq8$ . Without loss of generality, assume the divisors are all not divisible by 19.  \\n\\nUnder this assumption, we are done if the divisors include one divisible by 7 and another not divisible by 7, unless $n=8$ . In the latter case all of the divisors not divisible by 19 occur, including 1 and $3\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot7$ , so this case also follows. We now assume that none of the chosen divisors is divisible by 4, so that in particular $n\\\\leq4$ .  \\n\\nAgain, we are done if the divisors include one divisible by 5 and another not divisible by 5. But this can only fail to occur if $n=1$ or $n=2$ . The former case is trivial, while in the latter case we simply divide the larger divisor by the smaller one, and the resulting numerator has at least one prime divisor and so is at least 3.

By symmetry and because $x,y,z$ are distinct numbers,  \\n\\n$$\\nf(x,y,z)\\\\leq f(1,2,3)=2+{\\\\frac{5}{6}}<3.\\n$$  \\n\\nThus, if the divisibility is fulfilled we can have either $f(x,y,z)=1$ or $f(x,y,z)=2$ .

The answer is 10010. First observe that this is indeed a solution: $10010=2002{\\\\cdot}5=1781{\\\\cdot}4+222{\\\\cdot}13$ , so we may express 10010 as the sum of 2002 fives or of 1781 fours and 222 thirteens, where $1781+222=2003$ . To prove minimality, observe that a number is congruent modulo 9 to the sum of its digits, so two positive integers with the same digit sum are in the same residue class modulo 9. Let $k_{1}$ be the digit sum of the 2002 numbers and $k_{2}$ the digit sum of the 2003 numbers. Then $4k_{1}\\\\equiv2002k_{1}\\\\equiv2003k_{2}\\\\equiv5k_{2}$ (mod 9).

We show that $n=2$ is the only such integer. It is clear that $n=2$ satisfies the conditions. For $n>2$ , write  \\n\\n$$\\nn^{6}-1=(n^{3}-1)(n^{3}+1)=(n^{3}-1)(n+1)(n^{2}-n+1);\\n$$  \\n\\nhence, all prime factors of $n^{2}-n+1$ must divide $n^{3}-1$ or $n^{2}-1=$ $(n-1)(n+1).$ Note, however, that $\\\\left(n^{2}-n+1,n^{3}-1\\\\right)\\\\leq\\\\left(n^{3}+1,n^{3}-1\\\\right)\\\\leq2$ ; on the other hand, $n^{2}-n+1=n(n-1)+1$ is odd, so all prime factors of $n^{2}-n+1$ must divide $n+1$ . But $n^{2}-n+1=(n+1)(n-2)+3$ , so we must have $n^{2}-n+1=3^{k}$ for some $k$ . Because $n>2$ , we have $k\\\\geq2$ .

In particular, the values of $g(n)$ modulo 3 are $g(1)=1,1,1,2,0,1,0,0,\\\\ldots$ repeating with period 8.  \\n\\nNow let $h(n)=f(n)-g(n);h(n)$ counts permutations of the desired form where $n$ occurs in the middle, sandwiched between $n{-}1$ and $n{-}2$ . Removing $n$ leaves an acceptable permutation, and any acceptable permutation on $n-1$ symbols can be so produced except those ending in $n-4,n-2,n-3$ , $n-1$ .

Thus, we have the following result:  \\n\\n$$\\nf(k+1)-f(k)=\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l l}{{1}}&{{\\\\mathrm{if~binary~representation~of~}2k+1}}\\\\\\\\ {{\\\\ }}&{{\\\\mathrm{contains~three~digits~1}}}\\\\\\\\ {{0}}&{{\\\\mathrm{otherwise}}}\\\\end{array}\\\\right.\\n$$  \\n\\nIt proves that the function $f$ increases with at most a unit from $k$ to $k+1$ .  \\n\\nSince $g(2^{n})={\\\\binom{n}{3}}$ and $f(2^{n})={\\\\binom{n+1}{3}}-{\\\\binom{n}{3}}={\\\\binom{n}{2}}$ it follows that $f$ is unbounded function. If combine with the above property and observe that $f(4)=1$ one obtains that the range of $f$ is the set of all positive integers.  \\n\\nb) Let suppose that the equation $f(k)=m$ has a unique solution. It follows that  \\n\\n$$\\nf(k+1)-f(k)=f(k)-f(k+1)=1.\\n$$  \\n\\nBy (1), it follows that binary representations of $2k+1$ and $2k-1$ contain three digits 1. Then the binary representation of $k$ contains two digits 1. From $2k-1=2(k-1)+1$ one obtains that the binary representation of $k-1$ also contains two digits 1. Hence, the last digit of $k-1$ is $^{1}$ and the last but one digit is $0$ . Thus, $k-1=2^{n}+1$ and $k=2^{n}+2$ , where $n\\\\geq2$ .  \\n\\nFor such a number we have:  \\n\\n$$\\nf(2^{n}+2)=g(2^{n+1}+4)-g(2^{n}+2)=1+g(2^{n+1})-g(2^{n})=1+{\\\\binom{n}{2}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nThus, we have proved that the equation $f(k)=m$ has unique solution if and only if $m$ is a number of the form $m=1+{\\\\binom{n}{2}}$ $n\\\\geq2$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

Let $p$ be a prime number and m be a positive integer. Show that there exists a positive integer n such that there exist m consecutive zeroes in the decimal representation of $p^{n}$ .  \\n\\n(2001 Japanese Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. It is well-known that if $g c d(s,t)=1$ , then $s^{k}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{t}}$ ) for some $k$ : indeed, of all the positive powers of $s$ , some two $s^{k_{1}}<s^{k_{2}}$ must be congruent modulo $t$ , and then $s^{k_{2}-k_{1}}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{t}}$ .  \\n\\nFirst suppose that $p\\\\neq2,5$ . Then $g c d(p,10^{m+1})=1$ , so there exists such $k$ that $p^{k}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $10^{m+1}$ ). Then $p^{k}=a\\\\cdot10^{m+1}+1$ , so there are $m$ consecutive zeroes in the decimal representation of $p^{k}$ .  \\n\\nNow suppose that $p=2$ . We claim that for any $a$ , some power of 2 has the following final $a$ digits: $a-\\\\lceil\\\\log2^{a}\\\\rceil$ zeroes, followed by the $\\\\lceil\\\\log2^{a}\\\\rceil$ digits of $2^{a}$ . Because $g c d(2,5^{a})=1$ , there exists $k$ such that $2^{k}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $5^{a}$ ).  \\n\\nLet $b=k+a$ . Then $2^{b}\\\\equiv2^{a}$ (mod $5^{a}$ ), and $2^{b}\\\\equiv0\\\\equiv2^{a}$ (mod $2^{a}$ ). Hence, $2^{b}\\\\equiv2^{a}$ (mod $10^{a}$ ).

Then $2^{b}$ contains at least $m$ consecutive zeroes, as desired.  \\n\\nFinally, the case $p=5$ is done analogously to the case $p=2$ .  \\n\\nRemark. Actually, the property holds for every integer $p\\\\geq2$ . If $p$ is a power of 2, it is trivial.

Knowing $2^{29}$ an 9-digit number whose digits are distinct, without computing the actual number determine which of the ten digits is missing. Justify your answer.  \\n\\nSolution. It is not difficult to see that, when divided by 9, the remainder is 5. The ten-digit number containing all digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is a multiple of 9, because the sum of its digits has this property. So, in our nine-digit number, 4 is missing.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. It is well known that the divisibility tests for division by 3 and 9 do not depend on the order of the decimal digits. Prove that 3 and 9 are the only positive integers with this property. More exactly, if an integer $d>1$ has the property that $d|n$ implies $d|n_{1}$ , where $n_{1}$ is obtained from n through an arbitrary permutation of its digits, then $d=3$ or $d=9$ .  \\n\\nSolution. Let $d$ be a $k$ -digit number. Then among the $\\\\left(k+2\\\\right)$ -digit numbers starting with 10 there is at least one that is divisible by $d$ .

We are given three integers $a,b,c$ such that $a,b,c$ , $a+$ $b-c$ , $a+c-b$ , $b+c-a$ and $a+b+c$ are seven distinct primes. Let d be the difference between the largest and smallest of these seven primes. Suppose that $800\\\\in\\\\{a+b,b+c,c+a\\\\}$ . Determine the maximum possible value of $d$ .  \\n\\nSolution. Answer: 1594.  \\n\\nFirst, observe that $a,b,c$ must all be odd primes; this follows from the assumption that the seven quantities listed are distinct primes and the fact that there is only one even prime, 2. Therefore, the smallest of the seven primes is at least 3. Next, assume without loss of generality that $a+b=800$ . Because $a+b-c>0$ , we must have $c<800$ . We also know that $c$ is prime; therefore, since $799=17\\\\cdot47$ , we have $c\\\\leq797$ . It follows that the largest prime, $a+b+c$ , is no more than 1597. Combining these two bounds, we can bound $d$ by $d\\\\leq1597-3=1594$ . It remains to observe that we can choose $a=13$ , $b=787$ , $c=797$ to achieve this bound. The other four primes are then 3, 23, 1571 and 1597.  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

Is it possible to place 1995 different natural numbers along a circle so that for any two these numbers, the ratio of the greatest to the least is a prime?  \\n\\n(1995 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. No, this is impossible. Let $a_{0},\\\\dotsc,a_{1995}=a_{0}$ be the integers. Then for $i=1,\\\\ldots,1995$ , $a_{k-1}/a_{k}$ is either a prime or the reciprocal of a prime; suppose the former occurs $m$ times and the latter $1995-m$ times. The product of all of these ratios is $a_{0}/a_{1995}=1$ , but this means that the product of some $m$ primes equals the product of some $1995-m$ primes. This can only occurs when the primes are the same (by unique factorization), and in particular there have to be the same number on both sides. But $m=1995-m$ is impossible since 1995 is odd, contradiction.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Let $a,b,c,d$ be odd integers such that $0<a<b<c<d$ and $a d=b c$ .

But $b-a$ and $b+a$ differ by $2a$ , an odd multiple of 2, so either $b-a$ or $b+a$ is not divisible by 4. Hence, either $2^{m-1}|b-a$ or $2^{m-1}|b+a$ . But $0<b-a<b<2^{m-1}$ , so it must be that $2^{m-1}|b+a$ .  \\n\\nSince $0<b+a<b+c=2^{m}$ , it follows that $b+a=2^{m-1}$ and $b=2^{m-1}-a$ Then $c=2^{m-1}$ and $a d=b c=(2^{m-1}-a)(2^{m-1}+a)$ .  \\n\\nFrom this equality we obtain $a(a+d)=2^{2m-2}$ , hence $a=1$ .  \\n']"

If $n$ is even, then we can write it as $(2n)-(n)$ . If $n$ is odd, let $d$ be the smallest odd prime that does not divide $n$ . Then write $n=$ $(d n)-((d-1)n)$ . The number $d n$ contains exactly one more prime factor than $n$ . As for $(d-1)n$ , it is divisible by 2 because $d-1$ is even. Its odd factors are less than $d$ so they all divide $n$ .

The values are $k=(p+1)^{2}/4$ for $p$ odd (and none for $p=2$ ). We first consider $p=2$ , in which case we need $k^{2}-2k=(k-1)^{2}-1$ to be a positive square, which is impossible, as the only consecutive squares are 0 and 1.  \\n\\nNow assume $p$ is odd. We first rule out the case where $k$ is divisible by $p$ : if $k=n p$ , then $k^{2}-p k=p^{2}n(n-1)$ , and $n$ and $n-1$ are consecutive numbers, so they cannot both be squares.  \\n\\nWe thus assume $k$ and $p$ are coprime, in which case $k$ and $k-p$ are coprime.

Several positive integers are written on a blackboard. One can erase any two distinct integers and write their greatest common divisor and least common multiple instead. Prove that eventually the numbers will stop changing.  \\n\\n(1996 St. Petersburg City Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. If $a,b$ are erased and $c<d$ are written instead, we have $c\\\\leq\\\\operatorname*{min}(a,b)$ and $d\\\\ge\\\\operatorname*{max}(a,b)$ ; moreover, $a b=c d$ . From this we may conclude $a+b\\\\leq c+d$ writing $a b+a^{2}=c d+a^{2}\\\\leq a c+a d$ (the latter since $(d-a)(c-a)\\\\leq0,$ and dividing both sides by $a$ . Thus the sum of the numbers never decrease, and it is obviously bounded (e.g. by $n$ times the product of the numbers, where $n$ is the number of numbers on the board); hence it eventually stops changing, at which time the numbers never change.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. (a) For which positive integers n do there exist positive integers $x,y$ such that  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)=n!,\\\\quad g c d(x,y)=1998?\\n$$  \\n\\n(b) For which $n$ is the number of such pairs $x,y$ with $x\\\\leq y$ less than 1998?  \\n\\n(1998 Hungarian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. (a) Let $x=1998a$ , $y=1998b$ . So $a,b$ are positive integers such that $a<b$ , $g c d(a,b)=1$ . We have $\\\\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)=1998a b=2\\\\cdot3^{3}\\\\cdot37a b=n!$ . Thus $n\\\\geq37$ and it is easy to see that this condition is also sufficient.  \\n\\n(b) The answers are $n=37,38,39,40$ . We only need to consider positive integers $n\\\\geq37$ . For $37\\\\leq n<41$ , let $k=a b=n!/1998$ . Since $g c d(a,b)=1$ , any prime factor of $k$ that occurs in $a$ cannot occur in $b$ , and vice-versa. There are 11 prime factors of $k$ , namely 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31. For each of those prime factors, one must decide only whether it occurs in $a$ or in $b$ . These 11 decisions can be made in a total of $2^{11}=2048$ ways. However, only half of these ways will satisfy the condition $a\\\\ <\\\\ b$ . Thus there will be a total of 1024 such pairs of $(x,y)$ for $n=37$ , 38, 39, 40. Since  \\n\\n41 is a prime, we can see by a similar argument that there will be at least   \\n2048 such pairs of $(x,y)$ for $n\\\\geq41$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

Such $f$ exists for $k=0$ and $k=-1$ . First take $a=b$ in (b) to get $f(a^{2})=(k+2)f(a)$ . Applying this twice, we get  \\n\\n$$\\nf(a^{4})=(k+2)f(a^{2})=(k+2)^{2}f(a).\\n$$  \\n\\nOn the other hand,  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{c}{{f(a^{4})=f(a)+f(a^{3})+k f(a)=(k+1)f(a)+f(a^{3})}}\\\\\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\\\\\ {{=(k+1)f(a)+f(a)+f(a^{2})+k f(a)}}\\\\\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\\\\\ {{=(2k+2)f(a)+f(a^{2})=(3k+4)f(a).}}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nSetting $a=1997$ so that $f(a)\\\\neq0$ , we deduce $(k+2)^{2}=3k+4$ , which has roots $k=0,-1$ .

The only solution is $l=m=n=2$ . Let $d=g c d(l,m,n)$ , and put $l=d l_{1}$ , $m=d m_{1}$ , $n=d n_{1}$ . Then $d(m_{1}+n_{1})=d^{2}d_{m n}^{2}$ , where $d_{m n}=g c d(m_{1},n_{1})$ , so $m_{1}+n_{1}=d d_{m n}^{2}$ . Defining $d_{l n}$ and $d_{l m}$ likewise, we get  \\n\\n$$\\n2(l_{1}+m_{1}+n_{1})=d(d_{l m}^{2}+d_{l n}^{2}+d_{m n}^{2}).\\n$$  \\n\\nSince $\\\\frac{d}{g c d(d,2)}$ divides $l_{1}+m_{1}+n_{1}$ as well as $m_{1}+n_{1}$ , it divides $l_{1}$ and likewise $m_{1}$ and $n_{1}$ . As these three numbers are relatively prime, we have $\\\\frac{d}{g c d(d,2)}=1$ and so $d\\\\leq2$ .  \\n\\nNote that $d_{l m},d_{l n},d_{m n}$ are pairwise relatively prime; therefore we can write $l_{1}=l_{2}d_{l m}d_{l n}$ , $m_{1}=m_{2}d_{l m}d_{m n}$ , $n_{1}=n_{2}d_{l n}d_{m n}$ . Then we have  \\n\\n$$\\nd_{l m}d_{m n}m_{2}+d_{l n}d_{m n}n_{2}=d d_{m n}^{2}\\n$$  \\n\\nand so $m_{2}d_{l m}+n_{2}d_{l n}=d d_{m n}$ and so forth.

But these three numbers are pairwise relatively prime, so they are all 1. Then $m_{1}=n_{1}=1$ and from $l_{1}+m_{1}=d d_{l m}^{2}$ , $l_{1}=1$ as well. Therefore $l=m=n=2$ .  \\n']"

Since $\\\\varphi(2^{k})=2^{k-1}$ and we are looking for the least exponent $n$ such that $a^{n}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $2^{2000}$ ) it follows that $n$ is a divisor of $2^{1999}=\\\\varphi(2^{2000})$ .  \\n\\nIf $a\\\\equiv1$ (mod $2^{2000}$ ) it follows that $n=1$ . We shall omit this case.  \\n\\nConsider the decomposition:  \\n\\n$$\\na^{2^{m}}-1=(a-1)(a+1)(a^{2}+1)(a^{2^{2}}+1)\\\\dots(a^{2^{m-1}}+1).\\n$$  \\n\\nAssume $a\\\\equiv1$ (mod $2^{s}$ ) and $a\\\\not\\\\equiv1$ (mod $2^{s+1}$ ), where $2\\\\leq s\\\\leq1999$ .

Equivalently, $a$ has the binary representation  \\n\\n$$\\na=1\\\\ldots1\\\\underbrace{00\\\\ldots1}_{s d i g i t s}.\\n$$  \\n\\nIt is easy to show that for any integer $x$ , $x^{2}+1$ is not divisible by 4. Then, by the above decomposition $a^{2^{m}}-1$ is divisible by $2^{s+m}$ and it is not divisible by $2^{s+m+1}$ . Hence, the required number is $2^{2000-s}$ .  \\n\\nAssume that $a\\\\equiv-1$ (mod $2^{s}$ ) and $a\\\\not\\\\equiv-1$ (mod $2^{s+1}$ ), where $s\\\\geq2$ . Equivalently, $a$ has the binary representation  \\n\\n$$\\na=1\\\\ldots0\\\\underbrace{11\\\\ldots1}_{s d i g i t s}.\\n$$  \\n\\nLike before, $a-1$ is divisible by 2 and nondivisible by $2^{2}$ and $a^{2^{k}}+1$ is divisible by 2 and nondivisible by $2^{2}$ , $\\\\forall\\\\ k\\\\geq1$ . From the above decomposition $a^{2^{m}}-1$ is divisible by $2^{s+m}$ and nondivisible by $2^{s+m+1}$ . Hence, in this case, the required exponent is $n=2^{1999-s}$ when $s<1999$ and $n=2$ , when $s\\\\geq1999$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

If (b) holds, then $\\\\varphi(n)=(p_{1}-1)\\\\ldots(p_{k}-1)$ is coprime to $r$ , thus there exists $s$ with $r s\\\\equiv1$ (mod $\\\\phi(n)$ ), and the unique solution of $x^{r}\\\\equiv a$ (mod $n$ ) is $a=x^{s}$ . Conversely, suppose $x^{r}\\\\equiv a$ (mod $n$ ) has a solution for every $a$ ; then $x^{r}\\\\equiv a$ (mod $p_{i}^{r_{i}}$ ) also has a solution for every $a$ . However, if $r_{1}>a$ and $a$ is a number divisible by $p$ but not by $p^{2}$ , then $x^{r}$ cannot be congruent to $a$ , since it is not divisible by $p$ unless $x$ is divisible by $p$ , in which case it is already divisible by $p^{2}$ .

Find the smallest integer n such that among any $n$ integers, there exist $1\\\\delta$ integers whose sum is divisible by 18.  \\n\\n(1997 Ukrainean Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. The minimum is $n=35$ ; the 34-element set of 17 zeroes and 17 ones shows that $n\\\\geq35$ , so it remains to show that among 35 integers, there are 18 whose sum is divisible by 18. In fact, one can show that for any $n$ , among $2n-1$ integers there are $n$ whose sum is divisible by $n$ .  \\n\\nWe show this claim by induction on $n$ ; it’s clear for $n=1$ . If $n$ is composite, say $n=p q$ , we can assemble sets of $p$ integers whose sum is divisible by $p$ as long as at least $2p-1$ numbers remain; this gives $2q-1$ sets, and again by the induction hypothesis, some $q$ of these have sum divisible by $q$ .  \\n\\nNow suppose $n=p$ is prime.

This contradiction shows that the claim holds in this case. (Note: to solve the original problem, of course it suffices to prove the cases $p=2,3$ directly).  \\n\\nRemark.

Let $n$ have the required property. Then $p^{2}$ ( $p$ a prime) does not divide $n$ since $p^{2}$ does not divide $p^{25}-p$ . Hence $n$ is the multiple of different prime numbers. On the other hand $2^{25}-2=2{\\\\cdot}3^{2}$ 5 7 13 17 241. But $n$ is not divisible by 17 and 241 since $3^{25}\\\\equiv-3$ (mod 17) and $3^{25}\\\\equiv32$ (mod 241). The Fermat Theorem implies that $a^{25}\\\\equiv a$ (mod $p$ ) when $p=2,3,5,7,13$ .

Thus, $a^{k}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{p}}\\\\Rightarrow a^{c}\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{p}}\\\\Rightarrow a^{1-b(p-1)}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). If $a=0$ this is impossible. Otherwise, by Fermat’s Little Theorem, $(a^{-b})^{p-1}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ) so that $a\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ), as desired.  \\n\\nAlternatively, again note that clearly $a\\\\ \\\\not\\\\equiv\\\\ 0$ (mod $p$ ). Then let $d$ be the order of $a$ , the smallest positive integer such that $\\\\boldsymbol{a}^{d}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ); we have $d|k$ . Take the set $\\\\{1,a,a^{2},\\\\ldots,a^{d-1}\\\\}$ .

Then from the claim, it follows that the set of elements $\\\\{1^{3},2^{3},\\\\dots,p^{3}\\\\}$ equals $\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,p\\\\}$ modulo $p$ .

But we have $2^{3m}+1\\\\equiv2$ (mod 7) and we get a contradiction.  \\n\\nThus, $m=1$ and $n=3$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Let $p$ be a prime number. Prove that there exists a prime number $q$ such that for every integer $n$ , the number $n^{p}-p$ is not divisible by $q$ .  \\n\\n( $44^{t h}$ IMO)  \\n\\nSolution. Suppose that for every prime $q$ , there exists an $n$ for which $n^{p}\\\\equiv p$ (mod $q$ ). Assume that $q=k p+1$ . By Fermat’s Little Theorem we deduce that $p^{k}\\\\equiv n^{k p}=n^{q-1}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $q$ ), so $q|p^{k}-1$ .  \\n\\nIt is known that any prime $q$ such that $q|\\\\frac{p^{p}-1}{p-1}$ must satisfy $q\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). Indeed, from $q|p^{q-1}-1$ it follows that $q|p^{g c d(p,q-1)}-1$ ; but $q\\\\nmid p-1$ becaus e p −1 ≡ 1 (mod p − 1), so gcd(p, q − 1) ̸= 1. Hence gcd(p, q − 1) = p. Now suppose q is any prime divisor of p − 1 . Then $q|g c d(p^{k}-1,p^{p}-1)=$ $p^{g c d(p,k)}-1$ , which implies that $g c d(p,k)>1$ , so $p|k$ . Consequently $q\\\\equiv1$ (mod p2). However, the number p − ${\\\\frac{p^{p}-1}{p-1}}=p^{p-1}+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+p+1$ must have at least one prime divisor that is not congruent to 1 modulo $p^{2}$ . Thus we arrived at a contradiction.  \\n\\nRemark. Taking $q\\\\equiv1{\\\\pmod{p}}$ is natural, because for every other $q,n^{p}$ takes all possible residues modulo $p$ (including $p$ too).

Choose that $p_{i}$ which minimizes this quantity and write $p_{i}=1+2^{r_{i}}m_{i}$ with $m_{i}$ odd. Then of course we have $n\\\\equiv1$ (mod $2^{m_{i}}$ ). Hence we can write $n-1=$ $2^{m}t$ .

The proof is easy. Indeed, if this is not the case, then $o_{p}(2)|2^{n}$ and so $p|2^{o_{p}(2)}-1|2^{2^{n}}-1$ . But this is impossible, since $p|2^{2^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}+1$ .

But not only it is easy to find such a sequence of Fermat’s coprime numbers, but in fact any two different Fermat’s numbers are relatively prime. Indeed, suppose that $d|g c d(2^{2^{n}}+1,2^{2^{n+k}}+1)$ . Then $d|2^{2^{n+1}}-1$ and so $d|2^{2^{n+k}}-1$ . Combining this with $d|2^{2^{n+k}}+1$ , we obtain a contradiction.

Moreover, if $g c d(q,m-1)\\\\neq1$ , then $q|m-1$ and because $q|1+m+\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot+m^{p-1}$ , it follows that $q|p$ . But $p|m$ and we find that $q|m$ , which is clearly impossible.  \\n\\nMore difficult is b). But we are tempted to use a) and to explore the properties of $f_{p}(m)$ , just like in the previous problem. So, let us take a prime $q|f_{p}(m)$ for a certain positive integer $m$ divisible by $p$ . Then we have of course $q|m^{p}-1$ . But this implies that $o_{\\\\boldsymbol q}(m)|\\\\boldsymbol q$ and consequently $o_{q}(m)\\\\in\\\\{1,p\\\\}$ . If $o_{q}(m)~=~p$ , then $q\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). Otherwise, $q|m-$  \\n\\n1 and because $q|f_{p}(m)$ , we deduce that $q|p$ , hence $q\\\\ =\\\\ p$ . But we have seen while solving a) that this is not possible, so the only choice is $p|q-$ 1. Now, we need to find a sequence $(m_{k})_{k\\\\geq1}$ of multiples of $p$ such that $f_{p}(m_{k})$ are pairwise relatively prime. This is not as easy as in the first example. Anyway, just by trial and error, it is not difficult to find such a sequence. There are many other approaches, but we like the following one: take $m_{1}=p$ and $m_{k}=p f(m_{1})f_{p}(m_{2})\\\\ldots f_{p}(m_{k-1})$ . Let us prove that $f_{p}(m_{k})$ is relatively prime to $f_{p}(m_{1}),f_{p}(m_{2}),\\\\ldots,f_{p}(m_{k-1})$ . Fortunately, this is easy, since $f_{p}(m_{1})f_{p}(m_{2})\\\\ldots f_{p}(m_{k-1})|f_{p}(m_{k})-f_{p}(0)|f_{p}(m_{k})-1$ . The solution ends here.  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

But this is not difficult, because for all $i\\\\geq0$ the number $17^{2^{t}}+1$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. Thus, $v_{2}(17^{2^{k}}-1)=4+k$ and the order is found by solving the equation $k+4=2005$ . Thus, $O_{2^{2005}}(17)=2^{2001}$ is the answer to the problem.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Find all prime numbers $p,q$ such that $p^{2}+1|2003^{q}+1$ and $q^{2}+1|2003^{p}+1$ .  \\n\\nSolution. Let us suppose that $p\\\\leq q$ . We discuss first the trivial case $p=2$ . In this case, $5|2003^{q}+1$ and it is easy to deduce that $q$ is even, hence $q=2$ , which is a solution of the problem. Now, suppose that $p>2$ and let $r$ be a prime factor of $p^{2}+1$ . Because $r|2003^{2q}\\\\mathrm{~-~}1$ , it follows that $o_{r}(2003)|2q$ . Suppose that $(q,o_{r}(2003))=1$ . Then $o_{r}(2003)|2$ and $r|2003^{2}-1=2^{3}\\\\cdot3\\\\cdot7\\\\cdot11\\\\cdot13\\\\cdot167$ . It seems that this is a dead end, since there are too many possible values for $r$ . Another simple observation narrows the number of possible cases: because $r|p^{2}+1$ , must be of the form $4k+1$ or equal to 2 and now we do not have many possibilities: $r\\\\in\\\\{2,13\\\\}$ . The case $r=13$ is also impossible, because $2003^{q}+1\\\\equiv2$ (mod 13) and $r|2003^{q}+1$ . So, we have found that for any prime factor $r$ of $p^{2}+1$ , we have either $r=2$ or $q|o_{r}(2003)$ , which in turn implies $q|r-1$ . Because $p^{2}+1$ is even, but not divisible by 4 and because any odd prime factor of it is congruent to 1 modulo $q$ , we must have $p^{2}+1\\\\equiv2$ (mod $q$ ). This implies that $p^{2}+1\\\\equiv2$ (mod $q$ ), that is $q|(p-1)(p+1)$ . Combining this with the assumption that $p\\\\leq q$ yields $q|p+1$ and in fact $q=p+1$ . It follows that $p=2$ , contradicting the assumption $p>2$ . Therefore the only pair is (2,2).  \\n\\n# Proposed problems  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

It is quite clear that $p,q,r$ are distinct. Indeed, if for example $p=q$ , then the relation $p|q^{r}+1$ is impossible. We will prove that we cannot have $p,q,r>2$ . Suppose this is the case. The first condition $p|q^{r}+1$ implies $p|q^{2r}-1$ and so $o_{p}(q)|2r$ . If $o_{p}(q)$ is odd, it follows that $p|q^{r}-1$ , which combined with $p|q^{r}+1$ yields $p=2$ , which is impossible. Thus, $o_{p}(q)$ is either 2 or $2r$ . Could we have $o_{p}(q)=2r$ ? No, since this would imply that $2r|p-1$ and so $0\\\\equiv p^{q}+1$ ( $\\\\mod r)\\\\equiv2$ (mod $r$ ), that is $r\\\\ =\\\\ 2$ , false. Therefore, the only possibility is $o_{p}(q)=2$ and so $p|q^{2}-1$ . We cannot have p|q − 1, because p|qr + 1 and p ̸= 2. Thus, p|q + 1 and in fact p| q +2 1 . In the same way, we find that $q|\\\\frac{r+1}{2}$ and r p + 1 . $r|\\\\frac{p+1}{2}$ This is clearly impossible, just by looking at the largest among $p,q,r$ . So, our assumption was wrong and indeed one of the three primes must equal 2. Suppose without loss of generality that $p=2$ . Then $q$ is odd, $q|r^{2}+1$ and $r|2^{q}+1$ . Similarly, $o_{r}(2)|2q$ . If $q|o_{r}(2)$ , then $q|r-1$ and so $q|r^{2}+1-(r^{2}-1)=2$ , which contradicts the already established result that $q$ is odd. Thus, $o_{r}(2)|2$ and $r|3$ . As a matter of fact, this implies that $r=3$ and $q=5$ , yielding the triple (2,5,3). It is immediate to verify that this triple satisfies all conditions of the problem.

Without loss of generality assume $p\\\\leq q$ ; the unique solution will be (11,17), for which one may check the congruence using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

In addition, if $\\\\alpha$ is a primitive root mod $p$ , then $\\\\alpha^{3p q-1}\\\\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ) implies that $p-1$ divides $3p q-1$ as well as $3p q-1-3q(p-1)=$ $3q-1$ , and conversely that $q-1$ divides $3p-1$ . If $p=q$ , we now deduce $p=q=3$ , but $4^{27}\\\\equiv1$ (mod 27), so this fails. Hence $p<q$ .  \\n\\nSince $p$ and $q$ are odd primes, $q\\\\geq p+2$ , so $(3p-1)/(q-1)<3$ .

We must have $48|k!$ , so $k\\\\geq7=6$ ; one checks that $k=6$ does not yield a solution, so $k\\\\geq7$ .

It suffices to take 25 such numbers. To each number, associate the triple $(x_{2},x_{3},x_{5})$ recording the parity of the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 is its prime factorization. Two numbers have the same triple if and only if their product is a perfect square. As long as there are 9 numbers left, we can select two whose product is a square; in so doing, we obtain 9 such pairs. Repeating the process with the square roots of the products of the pairs, we obtain four numbers whose product is a fourth power.  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Find all collections of 100 positive integers such that the sum of the fourth powers of every four of the integers is divisible by the product of the four numbers.  \\n\\n(1997 St. Petersburg City Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. Such sets must be $n,n,\\\\ldots,n$ or $\\\\ 3n,n,n,\\\\ldots,n$ for some integer $n$ . Without loss of generality, we assume the numbers do not have a common factor. If $u,v,w,x,y$ are five of the numbers, then $u v w$ divides $u^{4}+v^{4}+$ $w^{4}+x^{4}$ and $u^{4}+v^{4}+w^{4}+y^{4}$ , and so divides $x^{4}-y^{4}$ . Likewise, $v^{4}\\\\equiv$ $w^{4}\\\\equiv x^{4}$ (mod $u$ ), and from above, $3v^{4}\\\\equiv0$ (mod $u$ ). If $u$ has a prime divisor not equal to 3, we conclude that every other integer is divisible by the same prime, contrary to assumption. Likewise, if $u$ is divisible by 9, then every other integer is divisible by 3. Thus all of the numbers equal $1$ or 3. Moreover, if one number is 3, the others are all congruent modulo 3, so are all 3 (contrary to assumption) or 1. This completes the proof.  \\n\\n', 'Problem.

As we have already seen in Problem 10.1.13, the set of all such integers $k$ is precisely the set of primes.

Otherwise, $0<j<p^{m-1}$ so that if $p^{t}<$ $p^{m-1}$ is the highest power of $p$ dividing $j$ , then it is also the highest power of p dividing both pm − j and pm−1 − j. Therefore pm 1− j contributes one factor of $p$ to $\\\\binom{n}{i}$ when $j=0$ and zero factors of $p$ when $j>0$ . Thus $p^{2}$ does not divide binomi, and hence again $r\\\\leq1$ .)  \\n']"

It would follow in this case that $2^{3^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}+1$ has at least $n-1$ distinct prime divisors of the form $8k+3$ (from the previous remarks) and since it is also divisible by 3, the conclusion would follow. Fix $i\\\\in\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,n-1\\\\}$ and observe that any prime factor of $2^{2\\\\cdot3^{\\\\circ}}-2^{3^{\\\\circ}}+1$ is also a prime factor of $2^{3^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}+1$ and thus, from the first remark, it must be of the form $8k+1$ or $8k+3$ .

Again suppose d divides both the numerator $p$ and denominator $2p+q$ . Then $d|(2p+q-p)$ or $d|2q$ . But since $p$ is odd, $d$ is odd, and so $d|q$ . Because $(p,q)=1$ , $d$ is equal to 1 and so $(p,2q+p)=1$ . Since $p$ and $2q+p$ are odd and are relatively prime, $a_{n}$ satisfies the conditions and completes the proof.  \\n\\nWe must now only consider the case where $a_{2001}=1/2$ .

Suppose that $a_{1},a_{2},\\\\dotsc$ . is a sequence of natural numbers such that for all natural numbers m and n, gcd(am, an) = agcd(m,n). Prove that there exists a sequence $b_{1},b_{2},\\\\dotsc$ of natural numbers such that $a_{n}=\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}b_{d}$ for all integers $n\\\\geq1$ .  \\n\\n(2001 Iranian Mathematical Olympiad)  \\n\\nSolution. For each $n$ , let $\\\\operatorname{rad}(n)$ denote the largest square-free divisor of $n$ (i.e. the product of all distinct prime factors of $n$ ). We let $b_{n}$ equal to the ratio of the following two numbers:  \\n\\n$E_{n}$ , the product of all $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$ such that $d$ is square-free, divides $n$ , and has an even number of prime factors.   \\n$O_{n}$ , the product of all $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$ such that $d$ is square-free, divides $n$ , and has an odd number of prime factors.  \\n\\nLemma 1. $\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid a_{n}}b_{d}=a_{n}.$  \\n\\nProof. Fix $n$ , and observe that $\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}b_{n}$ equals  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}E_{d}}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}O_{d}}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nIn the numerator of $(*)$ , each $E_{d}$ is the product of $a_{m}$ such that $m|d$ . Also, $d|n$ , implying that the numerator is the product of various $a_{m}$ such that $m|n$ . For fixed $m$ that divides $n$ , how many times does $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator $\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}E_{d}$ of (∗)?  \\n\\nIf $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ and $d|n$ , then let $t=d/m$ . By the definition of $E_{d}$ , we know that (i) $t$ is square-free and (ii) $t$ has an even number of prime factors. Because $d|n$ and $t=d/m$ , we further know that (iii) $t$ divides $n/m$ .  \\n\\nConversely, suppose that $t$ is any positive integer satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), and write $d=t m$ . By (iii), $d$ is a divisor of $n$ . Also, $t$ is square-free by (i), is a divisor of $d$ , and has an even number of prime factors by (ii). Thus, $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ .  \\n\\nSuppose that $n/m$ has $\\\\it l$ distinct prime factors. Then it has ${\\\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\\\binom{l}{2}}+$ . factors $t$ satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), implying that $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator of $(*)$ exactly  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\\\binom{l}{2}}+\\\\dots\\n$$  \\n\\ntimes. Similarly, $a_{m}$ appears in the denominator of $(*)$ exactly  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\binom{l}{1}}+{\\\\binom{l}{3}}+...\\n$$  \\n\\ntimes. If $m<n$ , then $l\\\\geq1$ and these expressions are equal, so that the $a_{m}$ ’s in the numerator and denominator of $(*)$ cancel each other out. If $m=n$ , then ${\\\\mathit{l}}=0$ , so that $a_{n}$ appears in the numerator once and in the denominator zero times. Therefore,  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\prod_{d|n}b_{d}=\\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{d|n}E_{d}}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{d|n}O_{d}}=a_{n},\\n$$  \\n\\nas desired.  \\n\\nLemma 2. For any integer $\\\\alpha$ that divides some term in $a_{1},a_{2},\\\\dotsb$ , there exists an integer d such that  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\alpha|a_{n}\\\\ \\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\ d|n.\\n$$  \\n\\nProof. Of all the integers $n$ such that $\\\\alpha|a_{n}$ , let $d$ be the smallest.  \\n\\nIf $\\\\alpha|a_{n}$ , then $\\\\alpha|g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}$ . By the minimal definition of $d$ , $g c d(d,n)\\\\geq d$ . But $g c d(d,n)|n$ as well, implying that $g c d(d,n)=d$ . Hence, $d|n$ .  \\n\\nIf $d|n$ , then $g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}=a_{d}$ . Thus, $\\\\displaystyle a_{d}|a_{n}$ . Because $\\\\alpha|a_{d}$ , it follows that $\\\\alpha|a_{n}$ as well. □  \\n\\nLemma 3. For each positive integer $n$ , $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer.  \\n\\nProof. Fix $n$ . Call an integer $d$ a top divisor (resp. a bottom divisor) if $d|n,n/d$ is square-free, and $n/d$ has an even (resp. odd) number of prime factors. By definition, $E_{d}$ is the product of $\\\\mathit{a}_{d}$ over all top divisors $d$ , and $O_{d}$ is the product of $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{d}$ over all bottom divisors $d$ .  \\n\\nFix any prime $p$ . We show that $p$ divides $E_{n}$ at least as many times as it divides $O_{n}$ . To do this, it suffices to show the following for any positive integer $k$ :  \\n\\n(1) The number of top divisors $d$ with $\\\\boldsymbol a_{n/d}$ divisible by $p^{k}$ is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ with divisible by $p^{k}$ . $\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$  \\n\\nLet $k$ be any positive integer. If $p^{k}$ divides none of $a_{1},a_{2},\\\\dotsc$ , then (1) holds trivially. Otherwise, by the previous lemma, there exists an integer $d_{0}$ such that  \\n\\n$$\\np^{k}|a_{m}\\\\ \\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\ d_{0}|m.\\n$$  \\n\\nHence, to show (1) it suffices to show:  \\n\\n(2) The number of top divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ , is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ .  \\n\\nIf $d_{0}\\\\nmid n$ , then (2) holds because $d_{0}$ does not divide $n/d$ for any divisor $d$ of $n$ , including top or bottom divisors.  \\n\\nOtherwise, $d_{0}|n$ . For which top and bottom divisors $d$ does $d_{0}$ divide $n/d$ ? Precisely those for which $d$ divides $n/d_{0}$ . If $n/d_{0}$ has $l\\\\geq1$ distinct prime factors, then there are as many top divisors with this property as there are bottom divisors, namely  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\\\binom{l}{2}}+\\\\cdots=2^{l-1}={\\\\binom{l}{1}}+{\\\\binom{l}{3}}+\\\\ldots\\n$$  \\n\\nIf instead $d_{0}=n$ and $\\\\mathit{l}\\\\mathit{\\\\Theta}=0$ , then the top divisor 1 is the only value $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ . In either case, there are at least as many top divisors $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ as there are bottom divisors with the same property. Therefore, (2) holds. This completes the proof. □  \\n\\nTherefore, $a_{n}=\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}b_{d}$ , and $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer for each $n$ .  \\n\\nAlternative solution. (Gabriel Dospinescu) Let us define $b_{1}=a_{1}$ and $b_{n}=\\\\frac{a_{n}}{l c m a_{d}}$ for $n>1$ . Of course, if $d|n$ , then $\\\\displaystyle a_{d}|a_{n}$ and so lcm ad|an and $\\\\begin{array}{l}{l c m a_{d}|a_{n}}\\\\\\\\ {d|n}\\\\\\\\ {d\\\\neq n}\\\\end{array}$ d|n $d\\\\neq n$ $b_{n}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}$ .  \\n\\nNow comes the hard part, proving that $\\\\prod_{d\\\\mid n}b_{d}=a_{n}$ , which is the same as  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\prod_{\\\\begin{array}{l}{d\\\\left|n}\\\\\\\\ {d\\\\neq n}\\\\end{array}\\\\right.}b_{d}=l c m a_{d}.}\\\\\\\\ {d\\\\neq n}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nWe will prove (1) by strong induction.

If $g c d(b_{u},b_{v})>1$ , then $u|v$ or $_{v|u}$  \\n\\nProof. We may assume that $u<v$ . Assume that $u$ does not divide $v$ . Then  \\n\\n$$\\nb_{u}=\\\\frac{a_{u}}{l c m a_{d}}|\\\\frac{a_{u}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}\\\\nonumber\\n$$  \\n\\n(since $g c d(u,v)\\\\neq u$ ) and also  \\n\\n$$\\nb_{v}|\\\\frac{a_{v}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nBut then  \\n\\n$$\\ng c d(b_{u},b_{v})|g c d\\\\left(\\\\frac{a_{u}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}},\\\\frac{a_{v}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{g c d(a_{u},a_{v})}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nNow, let $p$ be a prime number and let $i_{1}<i_{2}<\\\\dots<i_{k}$ such that $i_{q}|n$ , $i_{q}\\\\neq n$ for all $q$ and $b_{i_{q}}$ has the exponent of $p$ equal to $e_{q}\\\\geq1$ and any $b_{d}$ with $d|n$ , $d\\\\neq n$ , $d\\\\neq i_{q}$ for all $q$ is not a multiple of $p$ .

The function $f_{i}(a,b)$ is symmetric for any odd $i$ .  \\n\\nProof. We will prove also that $f_{i}(a,b)$ is symmetric function multiplied by $a$ . Now, we are to prove that $f_{2k-1}(a,b)$ is symmetric and $f_{2k-2}(a,b)=$ $a g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ , where $g_{2k-2}$ is symmetric too, for any positive integer $k$ . Proceed by induction on $k$ . For $k=1$ we have $f_{1}(a,b)=1$ and $g_{0}(a,b)=0$ .  \\n\\nSuppose that $f_{2k-1}(a,b)$ is symmetric and $f_{2k-2}(a,b)=a g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ where $g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ is symmetric too.

Proceed by induction on $k$ . For $k=1$ this statement is true. Let $x_{m}|x_{k m}$ . Then from (1) and (2) putting $r=k m$ and $i=m$ , we obtain the following. If $k m$ is even, then  \\n\\n$$\\nx_{m(k+1)}\\\\equiv f_{m}(a,b)x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv x_{m}x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv0{\\\\pmod{x_{m}}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nFor $k m$ odd $m$ is odd too and $f_{m}(a,b)=f_{m}(b,a)$ . Hence, we have  \\n\\n$$\\nx_{m(k+1)}\\\\equiv f_{m}(b,a)x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv f_{m}(a,b)x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv x_{m}x_{k m+1}\\\\equiv0{\\\\pmod{x_{m}}}.\\n$$  \\n\\nSo, for each nonnegative integers $k,m\\\\ x_{m}|x_{k m}$ .  \\n\\nSince the product $x_{n+1}x_{n+2}\\\\ldots x_{n+m}$ has $m$ terms, one of their indices is divisible by $m$ and another’s index is divisible by $m-1$ . Thus both $x_{m}$ and $x_{m-1}$ divide the product. If we can show that $x_{m}$ is relatively prime to $x_{m-1}$ , we would be done. We will prove this by induction. For the base case, $x_{0}$ is relatively prime to $x_{1}$ . Now, $x_{2n}=a x_{2n-1}-x_{2n-2}$ . Any prime factor common to $x_{2n}$ and $x_{2n-1}$ must also divide $x_{2n-2}$ , but because $x_{2n-2}$ is relatively prime to $x_{2n-1}$ , there is no such prime factor. A similar argument holds for $x_{2n+1}$ because $x_{2n+1}=b x_{2n}-x_{2n-1}$ . Thus $x_{m}x_{m-1}|(x_{n+1}x_{n+2}\\\\dots x_{n+m})$ .  \\n\\n', 'Problem. Let $m$ be a positive integer.

The ”if” direction of the claim is easily proven by induction on $n$ ; we prove the ”only if” direction by contradiction. Suppose, on the contrary, that there exist pairs satisfying the equation but not of the described form; let $(a,b)$ be such a pair with minimal sum $a+b$ . We claim that $(c,a)=(m^{2}a-b,a)$ is another such a pair but with smaller sum $c+a$ , which leads to a contradiction.  \\n\\n(a) $a=0$ . Then $(a,b)=(0,m)=(a_{0},a_{1})$ , a contradiction. (b) $a=m$ . Then $(a,b)=(m,m^{3})=(a_{1},a_{2})$ , a contradiction. (c) $a=1$ . Then $b\\\\geq1=1$ and $(b+1)|(b^{2}+1)$ ; but $(b+1)|(b^{2}-1)$ , thus $(b+1)|[(b^{2}+1)-(b^{2}-1)]=2$ . We have $b=1$ , thus $m=1$ and $(a,b)=(1,1)=(a_{1},a_{2})$ , a contradiction.  \\n\\n(d) $2\\\\leq a<m$ .

We have $b c=a^{2}-m^{2}>0$ ; since $b\\\\geq0$ , $c>0$ . Since $a>0$ and $c>0$ , $a c+1>0$ , we have  \\n\\n$$\\n{\\\\frac{c^{2}+a^{2}}{c a+1}}=m^{2}.\\n$$  \\n\\nSince $c>0$ , $b\\\\geq a$ and $b c=a^{2}-m^{2}<a^{2}$ , we have $c<a$ .

Then there must be some prime $q\\\\not\\\\in S$ less than 10000 such that  \\n\\n$$\\n(q+1)|(M_{2}+1)(M_{3}+1)(M_{5}+1)(M_{7}+1)(M_{13}+1)=2^{30}.\\n$$  \\n\\nThus, $q+1$ is a power of 2 and $q$ is a Mersenne prime less than 10000, and therefore $q\\\\in T=S$ , a contradiction.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, suppose $p$ is in $T$ . Suppose we have a set $S\\\\ =$ $\\\\{p_{1},p_{2},\\\\dotsc,p_{k}\\\\}\\\\subseteq P^{*}$ not including $p$ , with $k\\\\geq2$ and $p_{1}<p_{2}<\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot<$ $p_{k}$ . Suppose, by way of contradiction, that for all $q\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}^{*}$ such that $(q+1)|(p_{1}+1)\\\\dots(p_{k}+1)$ , we have $q\\\\in S$ . Then  \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\\\mathrm{4}|(p_{1}+1)(p_{2}+1)\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ M_{2}\\\\in S}\\\\\\\\ &{}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\mathrm{8}|(M_{2}+1)(p_{2}+1)\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ M_{3}\\\\in S}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\mathrm{32}|(M_{2}+1)(M_{3}+1)\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ M_{5}\\\\in S}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\mathrm{128}|(M_{2}+1)(M_{5}+1)\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ M_{7}\\\\in S}\\\\\\\\ &{\\\\mathrm{8192}|(M_{3}+1)(M_{5}+1)(M_{7}+1)\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ M_{13}\\\\in S.}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\n\\nThen $p$ , a Mersenne prime under 10000, must be in $S$ , a contradiction. Therefore there is some prime $q<10000$ not in $S$ with $q+1|(p_{1}+1)\\\\dots(p_{k}+$ 1), as desired. This completes the proof.  \\n']"
