Let $\Gamma$ be a circle with center $I$, and $ABCD$ a convex quadrilateral
such that each of the segments $AB$, $BC$, $CD$ and $DA$ is tangent to $\Gamma$.
Let $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of the triangle $AIC$.
The extension of $BA$ beyond $A$ meets $\Omega$ at $X$,
and the extension of $BC$ beyond $C$ meets $\Omega$ at $Z$.
The extensions of $AD$ and $CD$ beyond $D$ meet $\Omega$ at $Y$ and $T$, respectively.
Prove that
\[ AD + DT + TX + XA = CD + DY + YZ + ZC. \]
