Let $I$ be the incenter of a triangle $ABC$ and let $\Gamma$ be its circumcircle.
Let line $AI$ intersect $\Gamma$ again at $D$.
Let $E$ be a point on arc $\widehat{BDC}$ and $F$ a point on side $BC$ such that
\[ \angle BAF = \angle CAE < \tfrac12 \angle BAC. \]
Finally, let $G$ be the midpoint of $\ol{IF}$.
Prove that $\ol{DG}$ and $\ol{EI}$ intersect on $\Gamma$.
