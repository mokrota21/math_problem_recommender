A \emph{site} is any point $(x,y)$ in the plane
for which $x,y \in \{1, \dots, 20\}$.
Initially, each of the $400$ sites is unoccupied.
Amy and Ben take turns placing stones on unoccupied sites,
with Amy going first;
Amy has the additional restriction that no two of her stones
may be at a distance equal to $\sqrt5$.
They stop once either player cannot move.
Find the greatest $K$ such that Amy can ensure that
she places at least $K$ stones.
