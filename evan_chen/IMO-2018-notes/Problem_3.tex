An \emph{anti-Pascal triangle} is an equilateral triangular array
of numbers such that, except for the numbers in the bottom row,
each number is the absolute value of the difference
of the two numbers immediately below it.
For example, the following array is an anti-Pascal triangle
with four rows which contains every integer from $1$ to $10$.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale = 0.8]
\node at (1.5,2.58) {$4$};
\node at (1,1.72) {$2$};
\node at (2,1.72) {$6$};
\node at (0.5,0.86) {$5$};
\node at (1.5,0.86) {$7$};
\node at (2.5,0.86) {$1$};
\node at (0,0) {$8$};
\node at (1,0) {$3$};
\node at (2,0) {$10$};
\node at (3,0) {$9$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Does there exist an anti-Pascal triangle with $2018$ rows
which contains every integer from $1$ to $1+2+\dots +2018$?
