For each integer $k\geq 2$, determine all infinite sequences of positive integers
$a_1$, $a_2$, \dots\ for which there exists a polynomial $P$ of the form
\[ P(x)=x^k+c_{k-1}x^{k-1}+\dots + c_1 x+c_0, \]
where $c_0$, $c_1$, \dots, $c_{k-1}$ are non-negative integers, such that
\[ P(a_n)=a_{n+1}a_{n+2}\dotsm a_{n+k} \]
for every integer $n\geq 1$.
