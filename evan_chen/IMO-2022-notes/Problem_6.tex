Let $n$ be a positive integer.
A \emph{Nordic square} is an $n \times n$ board
containing all the integers from $1$ to $n^2$
so that each cell contains exactly one number.
An \emph{uphill path} is a sequence of one or more cells such that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \ii the first cell in the sequence is a \emph{valley},
  meaning the number written is less than all its orthogonal neighbors,

  \ii each subsequent cell in the sequence is orthogonally
  adjacent to the previous cell, and

  \ii the numbers written in the cells in the sequence are in increasing order.
\end{enumerate}
Find, as a function of $n$, the smallest possible total number
of uphill paths in a Nordic square.

\end{enumerate}
