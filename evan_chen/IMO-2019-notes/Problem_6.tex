Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incenter $I$ and incircle $\omega$.
Let $D$, $E$, $F$ denote the tangency points of $\omega$ with $\ol{BC}$, $\ol{CA}$, $\ol{AB}$.
The line through $D$ perpendicular to $\ol{EF}$ meets $\omega$ again at $R$ (other than $D$),
and line $AR$ meets $\omega$ again at $P$ (other than $R$).
Suppose the circumcircles of $\triangle PCE$ and $\triangle PBF$ meet again at $Q$ (other than $P$).
Prove that lines $DI$ and $PQ$ meet on the external $\angle A$-bisector.
