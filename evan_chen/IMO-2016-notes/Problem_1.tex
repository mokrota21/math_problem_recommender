In convex pentagon $ABCDE$ with $\angle B > 90\dg$,
let $F$ be a point on $\ol{AC}$ such that $\angle FBC = 90\dg$.
It is given that $FA=FB$, $DA=DC$, $EA=ED$,
and rays $\ol{AC}$ and $\ol{AD}$ trisect $\angle BAE$.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\ol{CF}$.
Let $X$ be the point such that $AMXE$ is a parallelogram.
Show that $\ol{FX}$, $\ol{EM}$, $\ol{BD}$ are concurrent.
