Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with $BA \neq BC$.
Denote the incircles of triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$
by $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ respectively.
Suppose that there exists a circle $\omega$ tangent
to ray $BA$ beyond $A$ and to the ray $BC$ beyond $C$,
which is also tangent to the lines $AD$ and $CD$.
Prove that the common external tangents to
$\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect on $\omega$.
