Let $R$ and $S$ be different points on a circle $\Omega$
such that $\ol{RS}$ is not a diameter.
Let $\ell$ be the tangent line to $\Omega$ at $R$.
Point $T$ is such that $S$ is the midpoint of $\ol{RT}$.
Point $J$ is chosen on minor arc $RS$ of $\Omega$ so that
the circumcircle $\Gamma$ of triangle $JST$ intersects $\ell$
at two distinct points.
Let $A$ be the common point of $\Gamma$ and $\ell$ closer to $R$.
Line $AJ$ meets $\Omega$ again at $K$.
Prove that line $KT$ is tangent to $\Gamma$.
