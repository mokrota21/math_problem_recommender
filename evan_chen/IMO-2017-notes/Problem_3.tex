A hunter and an invisible rabbit play a game in the plane.
The rabbit and hunter start at points $A_0 = B_0$.
In the $n$th round of the game ($n \ge 1$), three things occur in order:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \ii The rabbit moves invisibly from $A_{n-1}$ to a point $A_n$
  such that $A_{n-1} A_n = 1$.
  \ii The hunter has a tracking device (e.g.\ dog)
  which reports an approximate location $P_n$ of the rabbit,
  such that $P_n A_n \le 1$.
  \ii The hunter moves visibly from $B_{n-1}$ to a point $B_n$
  such that $B_{n-1} B_n = 1$.
\end{enumerate}
Let $N = 10^9$. Can the hunter guarantee that $A_N B_N < 100$?
