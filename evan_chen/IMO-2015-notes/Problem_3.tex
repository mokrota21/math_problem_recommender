Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $AB > AC$.
Let $\Gamma$ be its circumcircle, $H$ its orthocenter, and $F$ the foot of the altitude from $A$.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\ol{BC}$.
Let $Q$ be the point on $\Gamma$ such that $\angle HQA = 90\dg$
and let $K$ be the point on $\Gamma$ such that $\angle HKQ = 90\dg$.
Assume that the points $A$, $B$, $C$, $K$ and $Q$ are all different and lie on $\Gamma$ in this order.
Prove that the circumcircles of triangles $KQH$ and $FKM$ are tangent to each other.
