A function $f \colon \QQ \to \QQ$ is called \emph{aquaesulian}
if the following property holds: for every $x,y \in \mathbb{Q}$,
\[ f(x+f(y)) = f(x) + y \quad \text{or} \quad f(f(x)+y) = x + f(y). \]
Show that there exists an integer $c$ such that for any aquaesulian function $f$
there are at most $c$ different rational numbers of the
form $f(r) + f(-r)$ for some rational number $r$,
and find the smallest possible value of $c$.
