Because $y>10^{2b}x$ , we have ${\\sqrt{y}}>10^{b}{\\sqrt{x}}$ . Because $\\sqrt{y}$ and $10^{b}\\sqrt{x}$ are both integers, ${\\sqrt{y}}\\geq10^{b}{\\sqrt{x}}+1$ , so that $10^{2b}x+c=y\\geq10^{2b}x+2$ · $10^{b}{\\sqrt{x}}+1$ .

Let $s_{1}<s_{2}<\\cdots<s_{n}$ be these perfect squares. Clearly $d(s_{n})\\leq10^{6}$ . We now prove that if $n>1$ , then $d(s_{n})\\geq$ 1 + 2n−1.  \n\nBecause $s_{1},s_{2},\\ldots,s_{n}$ all have an even (resp. odd) number of digits, for each $i=1,2,\\ldots,n-1$ , we can write $s_{i+1}=10^{2b}s_{i}+c$ for some integers $b>0$ and $0\\leq c<10^{2b}$ .

Obviously, if $(a_{n})_{n}$ is such a sequence, so is $(a_{n+k})_{n}$ for all $k$ . Thus it suffices to find $p<q$ such that $a_{p}|a_{q}$ . Observe that from any 2001 consecutive natural numbers, at least one is a term of the sequence. Now, consider the table:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c c c}{{a_{1}+1}}&{{a_{1}+2}}&{{\\ldots}}&{{a_{1}+2001}}\\\\ {{a_{1}+1+x}}&{{a_{1}+2+x_{1}}}&{{\\ldots}}&{{a_{1}+2001+x_{1}}}\\\\ {{a_{1}+1+x_{1}+x_{2}}}&{{a_{1}+2+x_{1}+x_{2}}}&{{\\ldots}}&{{a_{1}+2001+x_{1}+x_{2}}}\\\\ {{\\vdots}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\\\ {{\\vdots}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nx_{1}=\\prod_{i=1}^{2001}(a_{1}+i),\\quad x_{2}=\\prod_{i=1}^{2001}(a_{1}+i+x_{1}),\\quad x_{3}=\\prod_{i=1}^{2001}(a_{1}+x_{1}+x_{2}+i)\n$$  \n\nand so on. Observe then that if $x,y$ are on the same column, then $x|y$ or $y|x$ . Now, look at the first 2002 lines. We find in this $2002\\times2001$ matrix at least 2002 terms of the sequence (at least one on each line), thus there are two terms of the sequence on the same column and one will divide the other.  \n\n","TopicMetadata":"(Some special problems in number theory)->(Sequences of integers)->(Nonstandard sequences of integers)","Problem":"Problem.
