The statement is false. To prove this, take $k=4$ and assume by contradiction that there exists a positive integer $n>1$ for which $\\binom{n}{i}$ is divisible by 4 for every $1\\leq i\\leq n-1$ . Then  \n\n$$\n0\\equiv\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{\\binom{n}{i}}=2^{n}-2\\equiv-2{\\pmod{4}},\n$$  \n\na contradiction.  \n\nRemark. As we have already seen in Problem 10.1.13, the set of all such integers $k$ is precisely the set of primes. Here we give an argument based on Kummer’s Theorem.  \n\nNow, suppose the claim holds for some $k>1$ with the number $n$ . If some prime $p$ divides $k$ , the claim must also hold for $p$ with the number $n$ . Thus $n$ must equal a prime power $p^{m}$ where $m\\geq1$ . Then $k=p^{r}$ for some $r\\geq1$ as well, because if two primes $p$ and $q$ divided $k$ then $n$ would equal a perfect power of both $p$ and $q$ , which is impossible.  \n\nChoose $i=p^{m-1}$ . Kummer’s Theorem states that $p^{t}|\\binom{n}{i}$ if and only if $t$ is less than or equal to the number of carries in the addition $(n-i)+i$ in base $p$ .

Since $A$ is an integer,  \n\n$$\n0\\equiv(m+3)^{n}+1\\equiv m^{n}+1{\\pmod{3}},\\qquad\n$$  \n\nso $n=2k+1$ is odd and $m\\equiv-1$ (mod 3). We consider the following cases.

Because $m\\equiv-1$ (mod 3), there exists an odd prime $p$ such that $p\\equiv-1$ (mod 3) and $p|m$ . Since $A$ is an integer,  \n\n$$\n0\\equiv(m+3)^{n}+1\\equiv3^{2k+1}+1{\\pmod{m}}\n$$  \n\nand $3^{2k+1}\\equiv-1$ (mod $p$ ). Let $a$ be a primitive root modulo $p$ ; let $b$ be a positive integer such that $3\\equiv a^{b}$ (mod $p$ ). Thus $a^{(2k+1)b}\\equiv-1$ (mod $p$ ). Note that $(p/3)=(-1/3)=-1$ .

         "Solution. In fact, every integer that is not divisible by 10 divides some element of $X$ . We first note that there exists a multiple of $4^{p}$ in $X$ with $2p-1$ digits for all nonnegative integer $p$ . This follows by induction on $p$ : it’s obvious for $p=0,1$ , and if $x$ is such a multiple for $p=k$ , then we can choose $a_{2k}$ so that $x+a_{2k}10^{2k}\\equiv0$ (mod $4^{k+1}$ ) since $10^{2k}\\equiv0{\\pmod{4^{k}}}$ ).  \n\nNow we proceed to show that any integer $n$ that isn’t divisible by 10 divides some element of $X$ . Let $n=2^{p}k$ , where $k$ is odd. Then by the lemma above one can find a multiple of $2^{p}$ in $X$ . Let $m$ be the multiple, $d$ be the number of digits of $m$ , and $f=10^{d+1}-1$ . By Euler’s Theorem, $10^{\\varphi(f k)}\\equiv1_{}$ (mod $f k$ ). Therefore $m(10^{(d+1)\\varphi(f k)}-1)/(10^{d+1}-1)$ is divisible by $2^{p}k$ and lies in $X$ (since it is the concatenation of $m$ ’s).  \n\n# Proposed problems  \n\n",

         "Solution. The statement is false.

Then  \n\n$$\n0\\equiv\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{\\binom{n}{i}}=2^{n}-2\\equiv-2{\\pmod{4}},\n$$  \n\na contradiction.  \n\nRemark. As we have already seen in Problem 10.1.13, the set of all such integers $k$ is precisely the set of primes. Here we give an argument based on Kummer’s Theorem.  \n\nNow, suppose the claim holds for some $k>1$ with the number $n$ . If some prime $p$ divides $k$ , the claim must also hold for $p$ with the number $n$ . Thus $n$ must equal a prime power $p^{m}$ where $m\\geq1$ . Then $k=p^{r}$ for some $r\\geq1$ as well, because if two primes $p$ and $q$ divided $k$ then $n$ would equal a perfect power of both $p$ and $q$ , which is impossible.  \n\nChoose $i=p^{m-1}$ . Kummer’s Theorem states that $p^{t}|\\binom{n}{i}$ if and only if $t$ is less than or equal to the number of carries in the addition $(n-i)+i$ in base $p$ . There is only such carry, between the $p^{m-1}$ and $p^{m}$ places:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\begin{array}{r c l l l}{\\displaystyle{+}}&{\\displaystyle{\\begin{array}{r c l l l l}{\\displaystyle{1}}&{\\displaystyle{0}}&{\\displaystyle{0}}&{\\displaystyle{\\ldots}}&{\\displaystyle{0}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{p-1}}&{\\displaystyle{0}}&{\\displaystyle{0}}&{\\displaystyle{\\ldots}}&{\\displaystyle{0}}\\end{array}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThus, we must have $r\\leq1$ and $k$ must be prime, as claimed. (Alternatively, for $n=p^{m}$ and $i=p^{m-1}$ we have  \n\n$$\n{\\binom{n}{i}}=\\prod_{j=0}^{p^{m-1}-1}{\\frac{p^{m}-j}{p^{m-1}-j}}.\n$$  \n\nWhen $j=0$ then ${\\frac{p^{m}-j}{p^{m-1}-j}}=p$ . Otherwise, $0<j<p^{m-1}$ so that if $p^{t}<$ $p^{m-1}$ is the highest power of $p$ dividing $j$ , then it is also the highest power of p dividing both pm − j and pm−1 − j. Therefore pm 1− j contributes one factor of $p$ to $\\binom{n}{i}$ when $j=0$ and zero factors of $p$ when $j>0$ . Thus $p^{2}$ does not divide binomi, and hence again $r\\leq1$ .)  \n",

We now prove that if $n>1$ , then $d(s_{n})\\geq$ 1 + 2n−1.  \n\nBecause $s_{1},s_{2},\\ldots,s_{n}$ all have an even (resp. odd) number of digits, for each $i=1,2,\\ldots,n-1$ , we can write $s_{i+1}=10^{2b}s_{i}+c$ for some integers $b>0$ and $0\\leq c<10^{2b}$ .
