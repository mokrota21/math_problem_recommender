We refer to the digits of the number besides the two 97s as interior digits; the sum of these digits is $99-2(9+7)=67$ . Since each digit is at most 9, there are at least 8 such digits.  \n\nNote that the sum of digits being 99 forces the number to be divisible by 9; thus it suffices to ensure that the number be divisible by 11, which is to say, the alternating sum of digits must be divisible by 11.  \n\nSuppose the number has exactly 8 interior digits. If $a$ is the sum of the odd interior places and $b$ the sum of the even places, we have $a+b=67$ and $a-b\\equiv-3$ (mod 11).

Consider a $k$ -digit integer $n$ such that the last $d$ digits of $n$ have the property described in the first Lemma. We can choose each of the other digits of $n$ to be any number between zero and nine. We know that the sum of the last $d$ digits of $n$ is between $d$ and $2d$ , and we can choose the sum of the other $k-d$ digits to be any number between $k-d$ and $9(k-d)$ . Since $k-d+2d\\leq2^{d}\\leq9(k-d)+d$ , we can choose the other digits such that the sum of the digits of $n$ is $2^{d}$ . This completes the proof because $n$ is a multiple of $2^{d}$ .  \n\nRemark.

Exactly in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 1.7.1 one can prove that any two $d$ -digit numbers which have only ones and twos give different residues mod $2^{d}$ .

For $k=1$ , $n=1$ has the desired property. For $k=2$ , $n=12$ has the desired property. Now, for each $k>2$ we have some number $d$ satisfying the condition Lemma 2. Consider a $k$ -digit integer $n$ such that the last $d$ digits of $n$ have the property described in the first Lemma. We can choose each of the other digits of $n$ to be any number between zero and nine. We know that the sum of the last $d$ digits of $n$ is between $d$ and $2d$ , and we can choose the sum of the other $k-d$ digits to be any number between $k-d$ and $9(k-d)$ . Since $k-d+2d\\leq2^{d}\\leq9(k-d)+d$ , we can choose the other digits such that the sum of the digits of $n$ is $2^{d}$ . This completes the proof because $n$ is a multiple of $2^{d}$ .  \n\nRemark.

Define $A=\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty}A_{i}$ where $A_{i}$ is the set of numbers which are product of $i+1$ distinct primes which are different from $p_{i}$ .

It is obvious that $S_{1}\\subset S_{2}\\subset\\cdots\\subset S_{n}\\subset\\ldots.$ This chain is not stationary because $S=\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty}S_{i}$ .

Two numbers have the same triple if and only if their product is a perfect square.

The answer is 10010.

To prove minimality, observe that a number is congruent modulo 9 to the sum of its digits, so two positive integers with the same digit sum are in the same residue class modulo 9.

Indeed, if for example $p=q$ , then the relation $p|q^{r}+1$ is impossible. We will prove that we cannot have $p,q,r>2$ . Suppose this is the case. The first condition $p|q^{r}+1$ implies $p|q^{2r}-1$ and so $o_{p}(q)|2r$ . If $o_{p}(q)$ is odd, it follows that $p|q^{r}-1$ , which combined with $p|q^{r}+1$ yields $p=2$ , which is impossible. Thus, $o_{p}(q)$ is either 2 or $2r$ . Could we have $o_{p}(q)=2r$ ? No, since this would imply that $2r|p-1$ and so $0\\equiv p^{q}+1$ ( $\\mod r)\\equiv2$ (mod $r$ ), that is $r\\ =\\ 2$ , false. Therefore, the only possibility is $o_{p}(q)=2$ and so $p|q^{2}-1$ . We cannot have p|q \u2212 1, because p|qr + 1 and p \u0338= 2. Thus, p|q + 1 and in fact p| q +2 1 . In the same way, we find that $q|\\frac{r+1}{2}$ and r p + 1 . $r|\\frac{p+1}{2}$ This is clearly impossible, just by looking at the largest among $p,q,r$ . So, our assumption was wrong and indeed one of the three primes must equal 2. Suppose without loss of generality that $p=2$ . Then $q$ is odd, $q|r^{2}+1$ and $r|2^{q}+1$ . Similarly, $o_{r}(2)|2q$ . If $q|o_{r}(2)$ , then $q|r-1$ and so $q|r^{2}+1-(r^{2}-1)=2$ , which contradicts the already established result that $q$ is odd. Thus, $o_{r}(2)|2$ and $r|3$ . As a matter of fact, this implies that $r=3$ and $q=5$ , yielding the triple (2,5,3). It is immediate to verify that this triple satisfies all conditions of the problem.
