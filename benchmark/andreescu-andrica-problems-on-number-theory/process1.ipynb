      "One of the oldest and liveliest branches of mathematics, Number Theory, is noted for its theoretical depth and applications to other fields, including representation theory, physics, and cryptography. The forefront of Number Theory is replete with sophisticated and famous open problems; at its foundation, however, are basic, elementary ideas that can stimulate and challenge beginning students. This textbook takes a problem-solving approach to Number Theory, situating each theoretical concept within the framework of some examples or some problems for readers to solve. Starting with the essentials, the text covers divisibility, powers of integers, floor function and fractional part, digits of numbers, basic methods of proof (extremal arguments, pigeonhole principle, induction, infinite descent, inclusion-exclusion), arithmetic function, important divisibility theorems and Diophantine equations. Emphasis is also placed on the presentation of some special problems involving quadratic residues, Fermat, Mersenne, and perfect numbers, as well as famous sequences of integers such as Fibonacci, Lucas, and other important ones defined by recursive relations. By thoroughly discussing interesting examples and applications and by introducing and illustrating every key idea, by relevant problems of various levels of difficulty, the book motivates, engages and challenges the reader. The exposition proceeds incrementally, intuitively and rigorously uncovers deeper properties.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A special feature of the book is an outstanding selection of genuine Olympiad and other important mathematical contest problems solved using the methods already presented. The book brings about the unique and vast experience of the authors. It captures the spirit of an important mathematical literature and distills the essence of a rich problem-solving culture.  \n",
      "\n",
      "”Number Theory: Structures, Examples and Problems” will appeal to senior high school and undergraduate students, their instructors, as well as to all who would like to expand their mathematical horizons. It is a source of fascinating problems for readers at all levels and widely opens the gate to further explorations in mathematics.  \n",

      "a) is straightforward. In fact, we will prove that any prime factor of $f_{p}(m)$ is relatively prime with $m(m-1)$ . Take such a prime divisor $q$ .

Now, we need to find a sequence $(m_{k})_{k\\geq1}$ of multiples of $p$ such that $f_{p}(m_{k})$ are pairwise relatively prime. This is not as easy as in the first example. Anyway, just by trial and error, it is not difficult to find such a sequence. There are many other approaches, but we like the following one: take $m_{1}=p$ and $m_{k}=p f(m_{1})f_{p}(m_{2})\\ldots f_{p}(m_{k-1})$ . Let us prove that $f_{p}(m_{k})$ is relatively prime to $f_{p}(m_{1}),f_{p}(m_{2}),\\ldots,f_{p}(m_{k-1})$ . Fortunately, this is easy, since $f_{p}(m_{1})f_{p}(m_{2})\\ldots f_{p}(m_{k-1})|f_{p}(m_{k})-f_{p}(0)|f_{p}(m_{k})-1$ . The solution ends here.  \n",

Because $r|2003^{2q}\\mathrm{~-~}1$ , it follows that $o_{r}(2003)|2q$ . Suppose that $(q,o_{r}(2003))=1$ . Then $o_{r}(2003)|2$ and $r|2003^{2}-1=2^{3}\\cdot3\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13\\cdot167$ . It seems that this is a dead end, since there are too many possible values for $r$ . Another simple observation narrows the number of possible cases: because $r|p^{2}+1$ , must be of the form $4k+1$ or equal to 2 and now we do not have many possibilities: $r\\in\\{2,13\\}$ . The case $r=13$ is also impossible, because $2003^{q}+1\\equiv2$ (mod 13) and $r|2003^{q}+1$ . So, we have found that for any prime factor $r$ of $p^{2}+1$ , we have either $r=2$ or $q|o_{r}(2003)$ , which in turn implies $q|r-1$ . Because $p^{2}+1$ is even, but not divisible by 4 and because any odd prime factor of it is congruent to 1 modulo $q$ , we must have $p^{2}+1\\equiv2$ (mod $q$ ). This implies that $p^{2}+1\\equiv2$ (mod $q$ ), that is $q|(p-1)(p+1)$ . Combining this with the assumption that $p\\leq q$ yields $q|p+1$ and in fact $q=p+1$ .

Suppose $n$ is a good number that has at least two distinct prime factors. Let $n=p^{r}s$ , where $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $n$ and $s$ is not divisible by $p$ . Because $n$ is good, $p+s-1$ must divide $n$ . For any prime $q$ dividing $s$ , $s<p+s-1<s+q$ , so $q$ does not divide $p+s-1$ . Therefore, the only prime factor of $p+s-1$ is $p$ . Then $s=p^{c}-p+1$ for some $c>1$ . Because $p^{c}$ must also divide $n$ , $p^{c}+s-1=2p^{c}-p$ divides $n$ . Because $2p^{c-1}-1$ has no factors of $p$ , it must divide $s$ .

Suppose this is the case. The first condition $p|q^{r}+1$ implies $p|q^{2r}-1$ and so $o_{p}(q)|2r$ . If $o_{p}(q)$ is odd, it follows that $p|q^{r}-1$ , which combined with $p|q^{r}+1$ yields $p=2$ , which is impossible. Thus, $o_{p}(q)$ is either 2 or $2r$ . Could we have $o_{p}(q)=2r$ ? No, since this would imply that $2r|p-1$ and so $0\\equiv p^{q}+1$ ( $\\mod r)\\equiv2$ (mod $r$ ), that is $r\\ =\\ 2$ , false. Therefore, the only possibility is $o_{p}(q)=2$ and so $p|q^{2}-1$ . We cannot have p|q − 1, because p|qr + 1 and p ̸= 2. Thus, p|q + 1 and in fact p| q +2 1 . In the same way, we find that $q|\\frac{r+1}{2}$ and r p + 1 . $r|\\frac{p+1}{2}$ This is clearly impossible, just by looking at the largest among $p,q,r$ . So, our assumption was wrong and indeed one of the three primes must equal 2. Suppose without loss of generality that $p=2$ . Then $q$ is odd, $q|r^{2}+1$ and $r|2^{q}+1$ . Similarly, $o_{r}(2)|2q$ . If $q|o_{r}(2)$ , then $q|r-1$ and so $q|r^{2}+1-(r^{2}-1)=2$ , which contradicts the already established result that $q$ is odd. Thus, $o_{r}(2)|2$ and $r|3$ . As a matter of fact, this implies that $r=3$ and $q=5$ , yielding the triple (2,5,3). It is immediate to verify that this triple satisfies all conditions of the problem.

      "\n",
      "One of the oldest and liveliest branches of mathematics, Number Theory, is noted for its theoretical depth and applications to other fields, including representation theory, physics, and cryptography. The forefront of Number Theory is replete with sophisticated and famous open problems; at its foundation, however, are basic, elementary ideas that can stimulate and challenge beginning students. This textbook takes a problem-solving approach to Number Theory, situating each theoretical concept within the framework of some examples or some problems for readers to solve. Starting with the essentials, the text covers divisibility, powers of integers, floor function and fractional part, digits of numbers, basic methods of proof (extremal arguments, pigeonhole principle, induction, infinite descent, inclusion-exclusion), arithmetic function, important divisibility theorems and Diophantine equations. Emphasis is also placed on the presentation of some special problems involving quadratic residues, Fermat, Mersenne, and perfect numbers, as well as famous sequences of integers such as Fibonacci, Lucas, and other important ones defined by recursive relations. By thoroughly discussing interesting examples and applications and by introducing and illustrating every key idea, by relevant problems of various levels of difficulty, the book motivates, engages and challenges the reader. The exposition proceeds incrementally, intuitively and rigorously uncovers deeper properties.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A special feature of the book is an outstanding selection of genuine Olympiad and other important mathematical contest problems solved using the methods already presented. The book brings about the unique and vast experience of the authors. It captures the spirit of an important mathematical literature and distills the essence of a rich problem-solving culture.  \n",
      "\n",
      "”Number Theory: Structures, Examples and Problems” will appeal to senior high school and undergraduate students, their instructors, as well as to all who would like to expand their mathematical horizons. It is a source of fascinating problems for readers at all levels and widely opens the gate to further explorations in mathematics.  \n",

      "# Acknowledgments  \n",

      "Many problems are either inspired by or adapted from various mathematical contests in different countries. We express our deepest appreciation to the original proposers of the problems.

No, there is always a number congruent to 3 modulo 4: factoring such a number gives one factor congruent to 3 modulo 4, and changing that by 2 in either direction gives a number congruent to 3 modulo 4.  \n\n",
