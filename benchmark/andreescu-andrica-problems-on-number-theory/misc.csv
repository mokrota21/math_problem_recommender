(2003 Romanian Mathematical Olympiad)  

","Solution. There are two possible cases:  

Case I. $x\geq y\geq z$ .  

We denote $x-z=a\ge0$ , $y-z=b\ge0$ , $a\geq b$ . One obtains the equation $2z(a+b)+a^{2}+b^{2}=8$ . When $z\geq3$ , there are no solutions. For $z=2$ , we get $(a+2)^{2}+(b+2)^{2}=16$ , which again has no solution. When $z=1$ we obtain solutions $(x,y,z)=(3,1,1)$ or $(x,y,z)=(1,3,1)$ . When $z=0$ , $a^{2}+b^{2}=8$ and we get the solution $(x,y,z)=(2,2,0)$ .  

Case II. $x\geq z\geq y$ .  

Note again that $x-z=a$ , $y-z=b$ and obtain the solution $(x,y,z)=$ $(n+2,n-2,n)$ or $(x,y,z)=(n-2,n+2,n)$ .

If one of the numbers, say $x_{1}$ , is equal to $1$ , then $x_{1}+x_{2}=1+x_{2}>x_{2}=$ $x_{1}x_{2}$ . Hence the product $(x_{1}+x_{2})\cdot x_{3}\cdot\cdot\cdot x_{n}$ is greater than $x_{1}\cdot x_{2}\cdot\cdot\cdot x_{n}=p$ , false. Therefore $x_{k}\geq2$ for all $k$ .  

If one of the numbers is equal to 4 we can replace him with two numbers 2 without changing the sum or the product.  

Suppose that $x_{k}\geq5$ for some $k$ . Then $x_{k}<3(x_{k}-3)$ , so replacing the number $x_{k}$ with the numbers 3 and $x_{k}-3$ , the sum remains constant while the product increases, contradiction.  

Therefore all the numbers are equal to 2 or 3. If there are more than 3 numbers equal to 2, we can replace them by two numbers equal to 3, preserving the sum and increasing the product (as $2\cdot2\cdot2<3\cdot3$ ). Hence at most two terms equal to 2 are allowed. Since $1976=3\cdot658+2$ the maximum product is equal to $2\cdot3^{658}$ .

Write $q=a^{2}+d b^{2}$ and $p=x^{2}+d y^{2}$ for integers $a,b,x,y$ . Reversing the above construction yields the desired result. Indeed, solving for $u$ and  

$v$ after setting $a=x u+d y v$ , $b=x v-y u$ and $a=x u-d y v$ , $b=x v+y u$ gives  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle{u_{1}=\frac{a x-d b y}{p},\quad v_{1}=\frac{a y+b x}{p},}}\\ {\displaystyle{u_{2}=\frac{a x+d b y}{p},\quad v_{2}=\frac{a y-b x}{p}.}}\end{array}

Note that  

$$
(a y+b x)(a y-b x)=(a^{2}+d b^{2})y^{2}-(x^{2}+d y^{2})b^{2}\equiv0{\pmod{p}}.
$$  

Hence $p$ divides one of $a y+b x,a y-b x$ so that one of $\boldsymbol{v}_{1},\boldsymbol{v}_{2}$ is an integer. Without loss of generality, assume that $v_{1}$ is an integer. Because $r=u_{1}^{2}+$ $d v_{1}^{2}$ is an integer and $u_{1}$ is rational, $u_{1}$ is an integer as well and $r\in S$ , as desired.

(1998 Iranian Mathematical Olympiad)  

","Solution. If $x=1$ , then $a=b=1$ and we are done. So we may assume n $x>1$ . Write $x=\prod_{i=1}p_{i}^{\gamma_{i}}$ , where the $p_{i}$ are the distinct prime factors of $x$ . Since $a$ and $b$ divide $x^{a+b}$ , we have $a=\prod p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$ and $b=\prod p_{i}^{\beta_{i}}$ for some nonnegative integers $\alpha_{i},\beta_{i}$ .  

First suppose that some $\beta_{i}$ is zero, that is, $p_{i}$ does not divide $b$ . Then the given equation implies that $\gamma_{i}(a+b)=\alpha_{i}b$ , so that $(\alpha_{i}-\gamma_{i})b=a\gamma_{i}$ . Now $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$ divides $a$ but is coprime to $b$ , so $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$ divides $\alpha_{i}-\gamma_{i}$ also. But $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}>\alpha_{i}$ for $\alpha_{i}>0$ , contradiction. We conclude that $\beta_{i}>0$ .  

Now from the fact that  

$$
\gamma_{i}(a+b)=\beta_{i}+b\alpha_{i}
$$  

and the fact that $p^{\beta_{i}}$ does not divide $\beta_{i}$ (again for size reasons), we deduce that $p^{\beta_{i}}$ also does not divide $a$ , that is, $\alpha_{i}<\beta_{i}$ for all $i$ and so $a$ divides $b$ . Moreover, the equation above implies that $a$ divides $\beta_{i}$ , so we may write $b=c^{a}$ with $c\geq2$ a positive integer.  

Write $x/a=p/q$ in lowest terms (so $g c d(p,q)=1$ ). Then the original equation becomes $x^{a}p^{b}=b q^{b}$ . Now $p^{b}$ must divide $b$ , which can only occur if $p=1$ . That is, $x$ divides $a$ .  

If $x\neq a$ , then there exists $i$ with $\alpha_{i}\geq\gamma_{i}+1$ , so  

$$
\gamma_{i}(a+b)=\beta_{i}+\alpha_{i}b\geq(\gamma_{i}+1)b

and so $\gamma_{i}a>b$ . On the other hand, $a$ is divisible by $p_{i}^{\gamma_{i}}$ , so in particular $a\geq\gamma_{i}$ . Thus $a^{2}>b=c^{a}$ , or ${\sqrt{c}}<a^{1/a}$ ; however, $a^{1/a}<{\sqrt{2}}$ for $a\geq5$ , so this can only hold for $c=2$ and $a=3$ , in which case $b=8$ is not divisible by $a$ , contrary to our earlier observation.  

Thus $x=a$ , and from the original equation we get $b=x^{x}$ , as desired.

( $20^{t h}$ IMO)  

","Solution. Since $1978^{n}$ and $1978^{m}$ agree in their last three digits, we have  

$$
1978^{n}-1978^{m}=1978^{m}(1978^{n-m}-1)\equiv0{\pmod{10^{3}}}.
$$  

From the decomposition $10^{3}=2^{3}\cdot5^{3}$ and since $1978^{n-m}-1$ is odd we obtain $2^{3}|1978^{m}$ . From $1978=2\cdot989$ , it follows $m\geq3$ .  

Let us write $m+n=(n-m)+2m$ . Our strategy is to minimize $m+n$ by taking $m=3$ and seek the smallest value of $n-m$ such that  

$$
1978^{n-m}\equiv1{\pmod{5^{3}}}.
$$  

Since $(1978,5)=1$ , the problem is to find the order $h$ of the residue-class 1978 (mod 125). It is known that the order $h$ of an inversible residue-class modulo $m$ is a divisor of $\varphi(m)$ , where $\varphi$ is the Euler function. In our case,  

$$
\varphi(125)=5^{2}(5-1)=100.
$$  

Hence, $h|100$ . From $1978^{h}\ \equiv\ 1$ (mod 125) we also have $1978^{h}\ \equiv\ 1$ (mod 5). But $1978^{h}\equiv3^{h}$ (mod 5). Since the order of the residue-class 3 (mod 5) is 4, it follows $4|h$ . Using the congruence $1978\equiv-22$ (mod 125) we obtain:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{1978^{4}\equiv(-22)^{4}\equiv2^{4}\cdot11^{4}\equiv4^{2}\cdot121^{2}}\\ {=(4\cdot(-4))^{2}\equiv(-1)^{2}\equiv256\equiv6\not\equiv1{\pmod{125}}.}\end{array}
$$  

So we rule out the case $h=4$ . Because $h|100$ , the next possibilities are $h=20$ or $h=100$ . By a standard computation we have:  

$$
1978^{20}\equiv6^{5}\equiv2^{5}\cdot3^{5}\equiv32\cdot(-7)\equiv-224\equiv26{\pmod{125}}\not\equiv1{\pmod{125}}.
$$  

Hence we necessarily have: $h=m-n=100$ and $n+m=106$ .

[10] Andreescu, T.; Feng, Z.; Lee, G.; Loh, P., Mathematical Olympiads: Problems and ","Problem. Let $m,n$ be integers with $1\leq m<n$ . In their decimal representations, the last three digits of $1978^{m}$ are equal, respectively, to the last three digits of $1978^{n}$ . Find m and $n$ such that $m+n$ is minimal.  

( $20^{t h}$ IMO)  

Solution. Since $1978^{n}$ and $1978^{m}$ agree in their last three digits, we have  

$$
1978^{n}-1978^{m}=1978^{m}(1978^{n-m}-1)\equiv0{\pmod{10^{3}}}.
$$  

From the decomposition $10^{3}=2^{3}\cdot5^{3}$ and since $1978^{n-m}-1$ is odd we obtain $2^{3}|1978^{m}$ . From $1978=2\cdot989$ , it follows $m\geq3$ .  

Let us write $m+n=(n-m)+2m$ . Our strategy is to minimize $m+n$ by taking $m=3$ and seek the smallest value of $n-m$ such that  

$$
1978^{n-m}\equiv1{\pmod{5^{3}}}.
$$  

Since $(1978,5)=1$ , the problem is to find the order $h$ of the residue-class 1978 (mod 125). It is known that the order $h$ of an inversible residue-class modulo $m$ is a divisor of $\varphi(m)$ , where $\varphi$ is the Euler function. In our case,  

$$
\varphi(125)=5^{2}(5-1)=100.
$$  

Hence, $h|100$ . From $1978^{h}\ \equiv\ 1$ (mod 125) we also have $1978^{h}\ \equiv\ 1$ (mod 5). But $1978^{h}\equiv3^{h}$ (mod 5). Since the order of the residue-class 3 (mod 5) is 4, it follows $4|h$ . Using the congruence $1978\equiv-22$ (mod 125) we obtain:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{1978^{4}\equiv(-22)^{4}\equiv2^{4}\cdot11^{4}\equiv4^{2}\cdot121^{2}}\\ {=(4\cdot(-4))^{2}\equiv(-1)^{2}\equiv256\equiv6\not\equiv1{\pmod{125}}.}\end{array}
$$  

So we rule out the case $h=4$ . Because $h|100$ , the next possibilities are $h=20$ or $h=100$ . By a standard computation we have:  

$$
1978^{20}\equiv6^{5}\equiv2^{5}\cdot3^{5}\equiv32\cdot(-7)\equiv-224\equiv26{\pmod{125}}\not\equiv1{\pmod{125}}.
$$  

Hence we necessarily have: $h=m-n=100$ and $n+m=106$ .
