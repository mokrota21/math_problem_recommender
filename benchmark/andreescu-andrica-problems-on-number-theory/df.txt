Every other element in $T$ is bigger than $a$ and can\u2019t divide it, but divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\prime}=T\\backslash\\{a\\}$ . Hence $T$ suffices, completing the induction and the proof of the lemma. \u25a1  \n\nNow, write each number $n>1$ in its prime factorization  \n\n$$\nn=p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot p_{k}^{a_{k}},\n$$  \n\nwhere the $p_{i}$ are distinct primes and the $a_{i}$ ate positive integers. Notice that the color of $n$ will always be the same as the color of $P(n)=p_{1}p_{2}\\ldots p_{k}$ .  \n\nApply the lemma to the set $S$ consisting in all $P(i)$ for $\\begin{array}{r l}{i}&{{}=}\\end{array}$ $2,3,\\ldots,1000000$ to find a subset $T\\subset S$ such that every element of $S$  \n\ndivides an odd number of elements in $T$ . For each $q\\in S$ , let $t(q)$ equal the   \nnumber of elements in $T$ that divides, and let $u(q)$ equal the number of $q$   \nprimes dividing $q$ .  \n\nSelect all the numbers in $T$ , and consider how the color of a number $n>1$ changes. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of elements in $T$ not relatively prime to $n$ equals  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{q|P(n),q>1}(-1)^{u(q)+1}t(q).\n$$  \n\nIn particular, if $q|P(n)$ is divisible by exactly $m>0$ primes, then it is counted ${\\binom{m}{1}}-{\\binom{m}{2}}+{\\binom{m}{3}}-\\cdots=1$ time in the sum. (For example, if $n\\ =\\ 6$ then the number of elements in $T$ divisible by 2 or 3 equals $t(2)+t(3)-t(6)$ .)  \n\nBy the definition of $T$ , each of the values $t(q)$ is odd. Because there are $2^{k}-1$ divisors $q>1$ of $P(n)$ , the above quantity is the sum of $2^{k}-1$ odd numbers and is odd itself. Therefore after selecting $T$ , every number $n>1$ will switch color an odd number of times and will turn white.  \n\nFinally, select 1 to turn 1 white to complete the process.  \n\nNote. In fact, a slight modification of the above proof shows that $T$ is unique. With some work, this stronger result implies that there is in essence exactly one way to make all the numbers white up to trivial manipulations.  \n\nSecond solution. Yes, it is possible. We prove a more general statement, where we replace 1000000 in the problem by some arbitrary positive integer $m$ . We also focus on the numbers divisible by just a few primes instead of all the primes.  \n\nLemma. For a finite set of distinct primes $S~=~\\{p1,p_{2},...,p_{n}\\}$ , let $Q_{m}(S)$ be the set of numbers between $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ and $m$ divisible only by primes in $S$ . The elements of $Q_{m}(S)$ can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number in $Q_{m}(S)$ and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Then it is possible to reverse the coloring of $Q_{m}(S)$ by selecting several numbers in a subset $R_{m}(S)\\subseteq Q_{m}(S)$ .  \n\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction on $n$ . If $n=1$ , then selecting $p_{1}$ suffices. Now suppose $n>1$ , and assume without loss of generality that the numbers are all black to start with.  \n\nLet $T=\\{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n-1}\\}$ , and define $t$ to be the largest integer such that $t p_{n}\\leq m$ . We can assume $t\\geq1$ because otherwise we could ignore $p_{n}$ and just use the smaller set $T$ , and we\u2019d be done by our induction hypothesis.  \n\nNow select the numbers in $R_{m}(T),R_{t}(T)$ , and $p_{n}R_{t}(T)\\ =\\ \\{p_{n}x|\\ x\\ \\in$ $R_{t}(T)\\}$ , and consider the effect of this action on a number $y$ :  \n\n$y$ is not a multiple of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. If selecting $x\\in R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ \u2019s color, selecting $x p_{n}$ will change it back so that $y$ will become white.   \n$y$ is a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ and $R_{t}(T)$ has no effect on $y$ , but each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ \u2019s color.   \n$p_{n}|y$ but $y$ is not a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. Because $y\\neq p_{n}^{i}$ , it is divisible by some prime in $T$ so selecting the numbers in $R_{t}(T)$ makes $y$ black again. Finally, each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ \u2019s color.  \n\nTherefore, all the multiples of $p_{n}$ are the same color (black if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is even, white if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is odd), while all the other numbers in $Q_{m}(S)$ are white. If the multiples of $p_{n}$ are still black, we can select $p_{n}$ to make them white, and we are done. $\\boxed{\\begin{array}{r l}\\end{array}}$  \n\nWe now return to the original problem. Set $m=1000000$ , and let $S$ be the set of all primes under 1000000. From the lemma, we can select numbers between 2 and 1000000 so that all the numbers $2,3,\\ldots,1000000$ are white. Finally, complete the process by selecting 1.  \n",

We let $b_{n}$ equal to the ratio of the following two numbers:  \n\n$E_{n}$ , the product of all $\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$ such that $d$ is square-free, divides $n$ , and has an even number of prime factors.   \n$O_{n}$ , the product of all $\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$ such that $d$ is square-free, divides $n$ , and has an odd number of prime factors.  \n\nLemma 1. $\\prod_{d\\mid a_{n}}b_{d}=a_{n}.$  \n\nProof. Fix $n$ , and observe that $\\prod_{d\\mid n}b_{n}$ equals  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\displaystyle\\prod_{d\\mid n}E_{d}}{\\displaystyle\\prod_{d\\mid n}O_{d}}}.\n$$  \n\nIn the numerator of $(*)$ , each $E_{d}$ is the product of $a_{m}$ such that $m|d$ . Also, $d|n$ , implying that the numerator is the product of various $a_{m}$ such that $m|n$ . For fixed $m$ that divides $n$ , how many times does $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator $\\prod_{d\\mid n}E_{d}$ of (\u2217)?  \n\nIf $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ and $d|n$ , then let $t=d/m$ . By the definition of $E_{d}$ , we know that (i) $t$ is square-free and (ii) $t$ has an even number of prime factors. Because $d|n$ and $t=d/m$ , we further know that (iii) $t$ divides $n/m$ .  \n\nConversely, suppose that $t$ is any positive integer satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), and write $d=t m$ . By (iii), $d$ is a divisor of $n$ . Also, $t$ is square-free by (i), is a divisor of $d$ , and has an even number of prime factors by (ii). Thus, $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ .  \n\nSuppose that $n/m$ has $\\it l$ distinct prime factors. Then it has ${\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\binom{l}{2}}+$ . factors $t$ satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), implying that $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator of $(*)$ exactly  \n\n$$\n{\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\binom{l}{2}}+\\dots\n$$  \n\ntimes. Similarly, $a_{m}$ appears in the denominator of $(*)$ exactly  \n\n$$\n{\\binom{l}{1}}+{\\binom{l}{3}}+...\n$$  \n\ntimes. If $m<n$ , then $l\\geq1$ and these expressions are equal, so that the $a_{m}$ \u2019s in the numerator and denominator of $(*)$ cancel each other out. If $m=n$ , then ${\\mathit{l}}=0$ , so that $a_{n}$ appears in the numerator once and in the denominator zero times.

For any integer $\\alpha$ that divides some term in $a_{1},a_{2},\\dotsb$ , there exists an integer d such that  \n\n$$\n\\alpha|a_{n}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ d|n.\n$$  \n\nProof. Of all the integers $n$ such that $\\alpha|a_{n}$ , let $d$ be the smallest.  \n\nIf $\\alpha|a_{n}$ , then $\\alpha|g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}$ . By the minimal definition of $d$ , $g c d(d,n)\\geq d$ . But $g c d(d,n)|n$ as well, implying that $g c d(d,n)=d$ . Hence, $d|n$ .  \n\nIf $d|n$ , then $g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}=a_{d}$ . Thus, $\\displaystyle a_{d}|a_{n}$ . Because $\\alpha|a_{d}$ , it follows that $\\alpha|a_{n}$ as well. \u25a1  \n\nLemma 3. For each positive integer $n$ , $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer.  \n\nProof. Fix $n$ . Call an integer $d$ a top divisor (resp. a bottom divisor) if $d|n,n/d$ is square-free, and $n/d$ has an even (resp. odd) number of prime factors. By definition, $E_{d}$ is the product of $\\mathit{a}_{d}$ over all top divisors $d$ , and $O_{d}$ is the product of $\\boldsymbol{a}_{d}$ over all bottom divisors $d$ .  \n\nFix any prime $p$ . We show that $p$ divides $E_{n}$ at least as many times as it divides $O_{n}$ . To do this, it suffices to show the following for any positive integer $k$ :  \n\n(1) The number of top divisors $d$ with $\\boldsymbol a_{n/d}$ divisible by $p^{k}$ is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ with divisible by $p^{k}$ . $\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$  \n\nLet $k$ be any positive integer. If $p^{k}$ divides none of $a_{1},a_{2},\\dotsc$ , then (1) holds trivially. Otherwise, by the previous lemma, there exists an integer $d_{0}$ such that  \n\n$$\np^{k}|a_{m}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ d_{0}|m.\n$$  \n\nHence, to show (1) it suffices to show:  \n\n(2) The number of top divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ , is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ .  \n\nIf $d_{0}\\nmid n$ , then (2) holds because $d_{0}$ does not divide $n/d$ for any divisor $d$ of $n$ , including top or bottom divisors.  \n\nOtherwise, $d_{0}|n$ . For which top and bottom divisors $d$ does $d_{0}$ divide $n/d$ ? Precisely those for which $d$ divides $n/d_{0}$ . If $n/d_{0}$ has $l\\geq1$ distinct prime factors, then there are as many top divisors with this property as there are bottom divisors, namely  \n\n$$\n{\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\binom{l}{2}}+\\cdots=2^{l-1}={\\binom{l}{1}}+{\\binom{l}{3}}+\\ldots\n$$  \n\nIf instead $d_{0}=n$ and $\\mathit{l}\\mathit{\\Theta}=0$ , then the top divisor 1 is the only value $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ . In either case, there are at least as many top divisors $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ as there are bottom divisors with the same property. Therefore, (2) holds. This completes the proof. \u25a1  \n\nTherefore, $a_{n}=\\prod_{d\\mid n}b_{d}$ , and $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer for each $n$ .  \n\nAlternative solution. (Gabriel Dospinescu) Let us define $b_{1}=a_{1}$ and $b_{n}=\\frac{a_{n}}{l c m a_{d}}$ for $n>1$ . Of course, if $d|n$ , then $\\displaystyle a_{d}|a_{n}$ and so lcm ad|an and $\\begin{array}{l}{l c m a_{d}|a_{n}}\\\\ {d|n}\\\\ {d\\neq n}\\end{array}$ d|n $d\\neq n$ $b_{n}\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ .  \n\nNow comes the hard part, proving that $\\prod_{d\\mid n}b_{d}=a_{n}$ , which is the same as  \n\n$$\n\\prod_{\\begin{array}{l}{d\\left|n}\\\\ {d\\neq n}\\end{array}\\right.}b_{d}=l c m a_{d}.}\\\\ {d\\neq n}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWe will prove (1) by strong induction. For $n=1$ it is clear Now, for all $d|n$ , $d\\neq n$ , by inductive hypothesis we have  \n\n$$\na_{d}=\\prod_{d^{\\prime}\\mid d\\atop d\\neq n}b_{d^{\\prime}}\\mid\\prod_{d\\mid n\\atop d\\neq n}b_{d},\n$$  \n\nthus $\\prod b_{d}$ is a multiple of $l c m a_{d}$ . It remains to prove that $\\prod_{\\begin{array}{l}{d|n}\\\\ {d\\neq n}\\end{array}}b_{d}|\\operatorname*{lc}m a_{d}$ $d|n$ $\\stackrel{d|n}{d\\neq n}$ $d\\neq n$  \n\nThe essential observation is:  \n\nLemma. If $g c d(b_{u},b_{v})>1$ , then $u|v$ or $_{v|u}$  \n\nProof. We may assume that $u<v$ . Assume that $u$ does not divide $v$ . Then  \n\n$$\nb_{u}=\\frac{a_{u}}{l c m a_{d}}|\\frac{a_{u}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}\\nonumber\n$$  \n\n(since $g c d(u,v)\\neq u$ ) and also  \n\n$$\nb_{v}|\\frac{a_{v}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}.\n$$  \n\nBut then  \n\n$$\ng c d(b_{u},b_{v})|g c d\\left(\\frac{a_{u}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}},\\frac{a_{v}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}\\right)=\\frac{g c d(a_{u},a_{v})}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}.\n$$  \n\nNow, let $p$ be a prime number and let $i_{1}<i_{2}<\\dots<i_{k}$ such that $i_{q}|n$ , $i_{q}\\neq n$ for all $q$ and $b_{i_{q}}$ has the exponent of $p$ equal to $e_{q}\\geq1$ and any $b_{d}$ with $d|n$ , $d\\neq n$ , $d\\neq i_{q}$ for all $q$ is not a multiple of $p$ . From the lemma we find $i_{1}|i_{2}|\\dots|i_{k}$ . But then from the inductive hypothesis we have  \n\n$$\na_{i_{k}}=\\prod_{d|i_{k}}b_{d}\n$$  \n\nis a multiple of $b_{i_{1}}b_{i_{2}}\\ldots b_{i_{k}}$ , thus $l c m a_{d}$ has the exponent of $p$ greater than $\\scriptstyle d\\mid n\\mid\\$ $d\\not=n$   \nor equal to the exponent of $p$ in $\\prod b_{d}$ .

Thus, $o_{p}(q)$ is either 2 or $2r$ . Could we have $o_{p}(q)=2r$ ? No, since this would imply that $2r|p-1$ and so $0\\equiv p^{q}+1$ ( $\\mod r)\\equiv2$ (mod $r$ ), that is $r\\ =\\ 2$ , false. Therefore, the only possibility is $o_{p}(q)=2$ and so $p|q^{2}-1$ . We cannot have p|q \u2212 1, because p|qr + 1 and p \u0338= 2. Thus, p|q + 1 and in fact p| q +2 1 . In the same way, we find that $q|\\frac{r+1}{2}$ and r p + 1 . $r|\\frac{p+1}{2}$ This is clearly impossible, just by looking at the largest among $p,q,r$ . So, our assumption was wrong and indeed one of the three primes must equal 2. Suppose without loss of generality that $p=2$ . Then $q$ is odd, $q|r^{2}+1$ and $r|2^{q}+1$ . Similarly, $o_{r}(2)|2q$ . If $q|o_{r}(2)$ , then $q|r-1$ and so $q|r^{2}+1-(r^{2}-1)=2$ , which contradicts the already established result that $q$ is odd. Thus, $o_{r}(2)|2$ and $r|3$ . As a matter of fact, this implies that $r=3$ and $q=5$ , yielding the triple (2,5,3). It is immediate to verify that this triple satisfies all conditions of the problem. Moreover, all solutions are given by cyclic permutations of the components of this triple.  \n\n",

The number $d n$ contains exactly one more prime factor than $n$ . As for $(d-1)n$ , it is divisible by 2 because $d-1$ is even. Its odd factors are less than $d$ so they all divide $n$ .

Prove that again they are positive integers.  \n\n(1998 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \n\nSolution. Call the original numbers $x$ and $y$ and let $L=\\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)$ . For each number $n$ on the board consider the quotient $L/n$ ; during each operation, the quotients $L/b$ and $L/a$ become $L/b$ and $L/a-L/b$ . This is the Euclidean algorithm, so the two equal quotients would be $g c d(L/b,L/a)$ and the two equal numbers on the board are $L/g c d(L/x,L/y)$ .

Such sets must be $n,n,\\ldots,n$ or $\\ 3n,n,n,\\ldots,n$ for some integer $n$ . Without loss of generality, we assume the numbers do not have a common factor. If $u,v,w,x,y$ are five of the numbers, then $u v w$ divides $u^{4}+v^{4}+$ $w^{4}+x^{4}$ and $u^{4}+v^{4}+w^{4}+y^{4}$ , and so divides $x^{4}-y^{4}$ .

Because $\\sqrt{y}$ and $10^{b}\\sqrt{x}$ are both integers, ${\\sqrt{y}}\\geq10^{b}{\\sqrt{x}}+1$ , so that $10^{2b}x+c=y\\geq10^{2b}x+2$ \u00b7 $10^{b}{\\sqrt{x}}+1$ .

Let $s_{1}<s_{2}<\\cdots<s_{n}$ be these perfect squares. Clearly $d(s_{n})\\leq10^{6}$ . We now prove that if $n>1$ , then $d(s_{n})\\geq$ 1 + 2n\u22121.  \n\nBecause $s_{1},s_{2},\\ldots,s_{n}$ all have an even (resp. odd) number of digits, for each $i=1,2,\\ldots,n-1$ , we can write $s_{i+1}=10^{2b}s_{i}+c$ for some integers $b>0$ and $0\\leq c<10^{2b}$ . Because no $a_{i}$ equals $0$ , we further know that $0<c$ . Hence, by our lemma,  \n\n$$\nd\\left(s_{i+1}\\right)-1\\geq2(d(s_{i})-1)\n$$  \n\nfor each $i=1,2,\\ldots,n-1$ .

        "580": "Problem. Prove that for every positive integer n there is a positive integer k such that k appears in exactly n nontrivial Pythagorean triples.  \n\n(American Mathematical Monthly)  \n\nSolution. We will prove by induction that $2^{n+1}$ appears in exactly $n$ Pythagorean triples. The base case $n=1$ holds for $(3,2^{2},5)$ is the only such triple. Assume that $(x_{k},y_{k},z_{k})$ , where $x_{k}=u_{k}^{2}-v_{k}^{2}$ , $y_{k}=2u_{k}v_{k}$ , $z_{k}=$ $u_{k}^{2}+v_{k}^{2}$ , $k=1,\\dots,n$ are the $n$ triples containing $2^{n+1}$ . Then $(2x_{k},2y_{k},2z_{k})$ , $k=1,\\ldots,n$ are $n$ non-primitive Pythagorean triples containing $2^{n+2}$ and $(2^{2n+2}-1,2^{n+2},2^{2n+2}+1)$ is the only such primitive triple.  \n\nNo other triple with this property exists. Indeed, if $(u^{2}-v^{2},2u v,u^{2}+v^{2})$ were a triple containing $2^{n+2}$ , then we would have the following cases:  \n\ni) $u^{2}+v^{2}=2^{n+2}$ . Simplifying by the greatest possible power of 2 we get $a^{2}+b^{2}=2^{k}$ where $a$ and $b$ ate not both even. Then the left-hand side is congruent to $1$ or 2 (mod 4), while the right-hand side is 0 (mod 4), a contradiction.  \n\nii) $2u v=2^{n+2}$ . We simplify again by the greatest power of 2 and obtain $a b=2^{s}$ , where $a>b$ are not both even and $s\\geq1$ . It follows that $a=2^{s}$ and $b=1$ , yielding the triple generated by $(2^{2s}-1,2^{s+1},2^{2s}+1)$ multiplied by a power of 2, that is clearly among the non-primitive triples $(2x_{k},2y_{k},2z_{k})$ .  \n\niii) $u^{2}-v^{2}=2^{n+2}$ . Simplifying again by the greatest power of 2 we arrive at $a^{2}-b^{2}=2^{t}$ , where $a$ and $b$ are not both even and $t\\geq3$ . If one of $a$ and $b$ are even, then the left-hand side is odd, while the right-hand side is even, a contradiction. If $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $a-b=2$ and $a+b=2^{t-1}$ , yielding $a-2^{t-2}$ and $b=2^{t-2}-1$ . Again, we get a triple generated by $(2^{t},2(2^{2t-4}-1),2(2^{2t-4}+1))$ multiplied by a power of 2, which is clearly already among a non-primitive triple $(2x_{k},2y_{k},2z_{k})$ .  \n",

The only such sequence is 2,2,2,. . . which clearly satisfies the given condition.  \n\nLet $g_{n}=g c d(a_{n},a_{n+1})$ . Then $g_{n+1}$ divides both $\\boldsymbol a_{n+1}$ and $\\boldsymbol{a}_{n+2}$ , so it divides $g_{n}a_{n+2}-a_{n-1}=a_{n}$ as well. Thus $g_{n+1}$ divides both $a_{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{a}_{n+1}$ , and it divides their greatest common divisor $g_{n}$ .  \n\nTherefore, the $g_{i}$ form a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers and eventually equal some positive constant $g$ .

Find all $k\\in\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}}$ such that $\\sqrt{k^{2}-p k}$ is a positive integer.  \n\n(1997 Spanish Mathematical Olympiad)  \n\nSolution. The values are $k=(p+1)^{2}/4$ for $p$ odd (and none for $p=2$ ). We first consider $p=2$ , in which case we need $k^{2}-2k=(k-1)^{2}-1$ to be a positive square, which is impossible, as the only consecutive squares are 0 and 1.  \n\nNow assume $p$ is odd. We first rule out the case where $k$ is divisible by $p$ : if $k=n p$ , then $k^{2}-p k=p^{2}n(n-1)$ , and $n$ and $n-1$ are consecutive numbers, so they cannot both be squares.  \n\nWe thus assume $k$ and $p$ are coprime, in which case $k$ and $k-p$ are coprime. Thus $k^{2}-p k$ is a square if and only if $k$ and $k-p$ are squares, say $k=m^{2}$ and $k-p=n^{2}$ . Then $p=m^{2}-n^{2}=(m+n)(m-n)$ , which implies $m+n=p$ , $m-n=1$ and $k=(p+1)^{2}/4$ .  \n\n",

The solution is the set of all $(p,p-1)$ , for odd primes $p$ . The fact that all of these pairs are indeed solutions follows immediately from Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem. Now we show that no other solutions exist.  \n\nSuppose that $(m,n)$ is a solution. Let $p$ be a prime dividing $m$ . We first observe that $p>n$ .

A permissible move consists of selecting a number from 1 to 1000000 and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Initially all of the numbers are black. Is it possible to make a sequence of moves after which all of the numbers are colored white?  \n\n(1999 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  \n\nSolution. It is possible. We begin by proving the following lemma:  \n\nLemma. Given a set $S$ of positive integers, there is a subset $T\\subseteq S$ such that every element of $S$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ .  \n\nProof. We prove the claim by induction on $|S|$ , the number of elements in $S$ . If $|S|=1$ then let $T=S$ .  \n\nIf $|S|>1$ , then let $\\alpha$ be the smallest element of $S$ . Consider the set $S^{\\prime}=S\\backslash\\{a\\}$ , the set of the largest $|S|-1$ elements in $S$ . By induction there is a subset $T^{\\prime}\\subseteq S^{\\prime}$ such that every element in $S^{\\prime}$ divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\prime}$ .  \n\nIf $a$ also divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\prime}$ , then the set $T=T^{\\prime}$ suffices. Otherwise, consider the set ${\\cal T}={\\cal T}^{\\prime}\\cup\\{a\\}$ . $a$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ . Every other element in $T$ is bigger than $a$ and can\u2019t divide it, but divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\\prime}=T\\backslash\\{a\\}$ . Hence $T$ suffices, completing the induction and the proof of the lemma. \u25a1  \n\nNow, write each number $n>1$ in its prime factorization  \n\n$$\nn=p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot p_{k}^{a_{k}},\n$$  \n\nwhere the $p_{i}$ are distinct primes and the $a_{i}$ ate positive integers. Notice that the color of $n$ will always be the same as the color of $P(n)=p_{1}p_{2}\\ldots p_{k}$ .  \n\nApply the lemma to the set $S$ consisting in all $P(i)$ for $\\begin{array}{r l}{i}&{{}=}\\end{array}$ $2,3,\\ldots,1000000$ to find a subset $T\\subset S$ such that every element of $S$  \n\ndivides an odd number of elements in $T$ . For each $q\\in S$ , let $t(q)$ equal the   \nnumber of elements in $T$ that divides, and let $u(q)$ equal the number of $q$   \nprimes dividing $q$ .  \n\nSelect all the numbers in $T$ , and consider how the color of a number $n>1$ changes. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of elements in $T$ not relatively prime to $n$ equals  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{q|P(n),q>1}(-1)^{u(q)+1}t(q).\n$$  \n\nIn particular, if $q|P(n)$ is divisible by exactly $m>0$ primes, then it is counted ${\\binom{m}{1}}-{\\binom{m}{2}}+{\\binom{m}{3}}-\\cdots=1$ time in the sum. (For example, if $n\\ =\\ 6$ then the number of elements in $T$ divisible by 2 or 3 equals $t(2)+t(3)-t(6)$ .)  \n\nBy the definition of $T$ , each of the values $t(q)$ is odd. Because there are $2^{k}-1$ divisors $q>1$ of $P(n)$ , the above quantity is the sum of $2^{k}-1$ odd numbers and is odd itself. Therefore after selecting $T$ , every number $n>1$ will switch color an odd number of times and will turn white.  \n\nFinally, select 1 to turn 1 white to complete the process.  \n\nNote. In fact, a slight modification of the above proof shows that $T$ is unique. With some work, this stronger result implies that there is in essence exactly one way to make all the numbers white up to trivial manipulations.  \n\nSecond solution. Yes, it is possible. We prove a more general statement, where we replace 1000000 in the problem by some arbitrary positive integer $m$ . We also focus on the numbers divisible by just a few primes instead of all the primes.  \n\nLemma. For a finite set of distinct primes $S~=~\\{p1,p_{2},...,p_{n}\\}$ , let $Q_{m}(S)$ be the set of numbers between $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ and $m$ divisible only by primes in $S$ . The elements of $Q_{m}(S)$ can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number in $Q_{m}(S)$ and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Then it is possible to reverse the coloring of $Q_{m}(S)$ by selecting several numbers in a subset $R_{m}(S)\\subseteq Q_{m}(S)$ .  \n\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction on $n$ . If $n=1$ , then selecting $p_{1}$ suffices. Now suppose $n>1$ , and assume without loss of generality that the numbers are all black to start with.  \n\nLet $T=\\{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n-1}\\}$ , and define $t$ to be the largest integer such that $t p_{n}\\leq m$ . We can assume $t\\geq1$ because otherwise we could ignore $p_{n}$ and just use the smaller set $T$ , and we\u2019d be done by our induction hypothesis.  \n\nNow select the numbers in $R_{m}(T),R_{t}(T)$ , and $p_{n}R_{t}(T)\\ =\\ \\{p_{n}x|\\ x\\ \\in$ $R_{t}(T)\\}$ , and consider the effect of this action on a number $y$ :  \n\n$y$ is not a multiple of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. If selecting $x\\in R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ \u2019s color, selecting $x p_{n}$ will change it back so that $y$ will become white.   \n$y$ is a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ and $R_{t}(T)$ has no effect on $y$ , but each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ \u2019s color.   \n$p_{n}|y$ but $y$ is not a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. Because $y\\neq p_{n}^{i}$ , it is divisible by some prime in $T$ so selecting the numbers in $R_{t}(T)$ makes $y$ black again. Finally, each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ \u2019s color.  \n\nTherefore, all the multiples of $p_{n}$ are the same color (black if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is even, white if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is odd), while all the other numbers in $Q_{m}(S)$ are white. If the multiples of $p_{n}$ are still black, we can select $p_{n}$ to make them white, and we are done. $\\boxed{\\begin{array}{r l}\\end{array}}$  \n\nWe now return to the original problem. Set $m=1000000$ , and let $S$ be the set of all primes under 1000000. From the lemma, we can select numbers between 2 and 1000000 so that all the numbers $2,3,\\ldots,1000000$ are white. Finally, complete the process by selecting 1.  \n",

We prove the result by induction on $n$ . If $n=2$ , then $x=1$ suffices. Now suppose that the claim is true for $n\\geq2$ , that is, there is a natural number $y$ such that $y^{3}+17$ is divisible by $3^{n}$ but not $3^{n+1}$ .

Because 3 does not divide 17, 3 cannot divide $y$ either. Hence applying our result from the previous paragraph twice, once with $(a,m)=(y,n)$ and once with $(a,m)=(y+3^{n-1},n)$ , we find that $3^{n+1}$ must divide either $(y+3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ or $(y+2\\cdot3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ .  \n\nHence there exists a natural number $x^{\\prime}$ not divisible by 3 such that $3^{n+1}|{x^{\\prime}}^{3}+17$ . If $3^{n+2}$ does not divide ${x^{\\prime}}^{3}+17$ , we are done. Otherwise, we claim the number $x=x^{\\prime}+3^{n}$ suffices. Because $x=x^{\\prime}+3^{n-1}+3^{n-1}+3^{n-1}$ , the result from previous the paragraphs tells us that $x^{3}\\equiv{x^{\\prime}}^{3}+3^{n}+$ $3^{n}+3^{n}\\equiv x^{\\prime3}$ (mod $3^{n+1}$ ). Thus $3^{n+1}|x^{3}+17$ as well. On the other hand, because $x=x^{\\prime}+3^{n}$ , we have $x^{3}\\equiv{x^{\\prime}}^{3}+3^{n+1}\\not\\equiv{x^{\\prime}}^{3}$ (mod $3^{n+2}$ ). It follows that $3^{n+2}$ does not divide $x^{3}+17$ , as desired. This completes the inductive step.  \n\n# Proposed problems  \n\n",

For each $n$ , let $\\operatorname{rad}(n)$ denote the largest square-free divisor of $n$ (i.e. the product of all distinct prime factors of $n$ ). We let $b_{n}$ equal to the ratio of the following two numbers:  \n\n$E_{n}$ , the product of all $\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$ such that $d$ is square-free, divides $n$ , and has an even number of prime factors.   \n$O_{n}$ , the product of all $\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$ such that $d$ is square-free, divides $n$ , and has an odd number of prime factors.  \n\nLemma 1. $\\prod_{d\\mid a_{n}}b_{d}=a_{n}.$  \n\nProof.

Also, $d|n$ , implying that the numerator is the product of various $a_{m}$ such that $m|n$ . For fixed $m$ that divides $n$ , how many times does $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator $\\prod_{d\\mid n}E_{d}$ of (\u2217)?  \n\nIf $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ and $d|n$ , then let $t=d/m$ . By the definition of $E_{d}$ , we know that (i) $t$ is square-free and (ii) $t$ has an even number of prime factors. Because $d|n$ and $t=d/m$ , we further know that (iii) $t$ divides $n/m$ .  \n\nConversely, suppose that $t$ is any positive integer satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), and write $d=t m$ . By (iii), $d$ is a divisor of $n$ . Also, $t$ is square-free by (i), is a divisor of $d$ , and has an even number of prime factors by (ii). Thus, $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ .  \n\nSuppose that $n/m$ has $\\it l$ distinct prime factors. Then it has ${\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\binom{l}{2}}+$ . factors $t$ satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), implying that $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator of $(*)$ exactly  \n\n$$\n{\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\binom{l}{2}}+\\dots\n$$  \n\ntimes.

For any integer $\\alpha$ that divides some term in $a_{1},a_{2},\\dotsb$ , there exists an integer d such that  \n\n$$\n\\alpha|a_{n}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ d|n.\n$$  \n\nProof. Of all the integers $n$ such that $\\alpha|a_{n}$ , let $d$ be the smallest.  \n\nIf $\\alpha|a_{n}$ , then $\\alpha|g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}$ . By the minimal definition of $d$ , $g c d(d,n)\\geq d$ . But $g c d(d,n)|n$ as well, implying that $g c d(d,n)=d$ . Hence, $d|n$ .  \n\nIf $d|n$ , then $g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}=a_{d}$ . Thus, $\\displaystyle a_{d}|a_{n}$ . Because $\\alpha|a_{d}$ , it follows that $\\alpha|a_{n}$ as well. \u25a1  \n\nLemma 3. For each positive integer $n$ , $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer.  \n\nProof. Fix $n$ . Call an integer $d$ a top divisor (resp. a bottom divisor) if $d|n,n/d$ is square-free, and $n/d$ has an even (resp. odd) number of prime factors. By definition, $E_{d}$ is the product of $\\mathit{a}_{d}$ over all top divisors $d$ , and $O_{d}$ is the product of $\\boldsymbol{a}_{d}$ over all bottom divisors $d$ .  \n\nFix any prime $p$ . We show that $p$ divides $E_{n}$ at least as many times as it divides $O_{n}$ . To do this, it suffices to show the following for any positive integer $k$ :  \n\n(1) The number of top divisors $d$ with $\\boldsymbol a_{n/d}$ divisible by $p^{k}$ is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ with divisible by $p^{k}$ . $\\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$  \n\nLet $k$ be any positive integer. If $p^{k}$ divides none of $a_{1},a_{2},\\dotsc$ , then (1) holds trivially. Otherwise, by the previous lemma, there exists an integer $d_{0}$ such that  \n\n$$\np^{k}|a_{m}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ d_{0}|m.\n$$  \n\nHence, to show (1) it suffices to show:  \n\n(2) The number of top divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ , is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ .  \n\nIf $d_{0}\\nmid n$ , then (2) holds because $d_{0}$ does not divide $n/d$ for any divisor $d$ of $n$ , including top or bottom divisors.  \n\nOtherwise, $d_{0}|n$ . For which top and bottom divisors $d$ does $d_{0}$ divide $n/d$ ? Precisely those for which $d$ divides $n/d_{0}$ . If $n/d_{0}$ has $l\\geq1$ distinct prime factors, then there are as many top divisors with this property as there are bottom divisors, namely  \n\n$$\n{\\binom{l}{0}}+{\\binom{l}{2}}+\\cdots=2^{l-1}={\\binom{l}{1}}+{\\binom{l}{3}}+\\ldots\n$$  \n\nIf instead $d_{0}=n$ and $\\mathit{l}\\mathit{\\Theta}=0$ , then the top divisor 1 is the only value $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ . In either case, there are at least as many top divisors $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ as there are bottom divisors with the same property. Therefore, (2) holds. This completes the proof. \u25a1  \n\nTherefore, $a_{n}=\\prod_{d\\mid n}b_{d}$ , and $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer for each $n$ .  \n\nAlternative solution. (Gabriel Dospinescu) Let us define $b_{1}=a_{1}$ and $b_{n}=\\frac{a_{n}}{l c m a_{d}}$ for $n>1$ . Of course, if $d|n$ , then $\\displaystyle a_{d}|a_{n}$ and so lcm ad|an and $\\begin{array}{l}{l c m a_{d}|a_{n}}\\\\ {d|n}\\\\ {d\\neq n}\\end{array}$ d|n $d\\neq n$ $b_{n}\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ .  \n\nNow comes the hard part, proving that $\\prod_{d\\mid n}b_{d}=a_{n}$ , which is the same as  \n\n$$\n\\prod_{\\begin{array}{l}{d\\left|n}\\\\ {d\\neq n}\\end{array}\\right.}b_{d}=l c m a_{d}.}\\\\ {d\\neq n}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWe will prove (1) by strong induction. For $n=1$ it is clear Now, for all $d|n$ , $d\\neq n$ , by inductive hypothesis we have  \n\n$$\na_{d}=\\prod_{d^{\\prime}\\mid d\\atop d\\neq n}b_{d^{\\prime}}\\mid\\prod_{d\\mid n\\atop d\\neq n}b_{d},\n$$  \n\nthus $\\prod b_{d}$ is a multiple of $l c m a_{d}$ . It remains to prove that $\\prod_{\\begin{array}{l}{d|n}\\\\ {d\\neq n}\\end{array}}b_{d}|\\operatorname*{lc}m a_{d}$ $d|n$ $\\stackrel{d|n}{d\\neq n}$ $d\\neq n$  \n\nThe essential observation is:  \n\nLemma. If $g c d(b_{u},b_{v})>1$ , then $u|v$ or $_{v|u}$  \n\nProof. We may assume that $u<v$ . Assume that $u$ does not divide $v$ . Then  \n\n$$\nb_{u}=\\frac{a_{u}}{l c m a_{d}}|\\frac{a_{u}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}\\nonumber\n$$  \n\n(since $g c d(u,v)\\neq u$ ) and also  \n\n$$\nb_{v}|\\frac{a_{v}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}.\n$$  \n\nBut then  \n\n$$\ng c d(b_{u},b_{v})|g c d\\left(\\frac{a_{u}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}},\\frac{a_{v}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}\\right)=\\frac{g c d(a_{u},a_{v})}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}.\n$$  \n\nNow, let $p$ be a prime number and let $i_{1}<i_{2}<\\dots<i_{k}$ such that $i_{q}|n$ , $i_{q}\\neq n$ for all $q$ and $b_{i_{q}}$ has the exponent of $p$ equal to $e_{q}\\geq1$ and any $b_{d}$ with $d|n$ , $d\\neq n$ , $d\\neq i_{q}$ for all $q$ is not a multiple of $p$ .
