In a competition, there are $a$ contestants
and $b$ judges, where $b \ge 3$ is an odd integer.
Each judge rates each contestant as either ``pass'' or ``fail''.
Suppose $k$ is a number such that for any two judges,
their ratings coincide for at most $k$ contestants.
Prove that
\[ \frac ka \ge \frac{b-1}{2b}. \]
