An $n \times n$ matrix whose entries come
from the set $S = \{1, 2, \dots , 2n - 1\}$
is called a \emph{silver} matrix if,
for each $i = 1, 2, \dots , n$,
the $i$-th row and the $i$-th column together
contain all elements of $S$. Show that:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\ii there is no silver matrix for $n = 1997$;
\ii silver matrices exist for infinitely many values of $n$.
\end{enumerate}
