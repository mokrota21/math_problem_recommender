In the plane there is an infinite chessboard.
For any pair of positive integers $m$ and $n$,
consider a right-angled triangle with vertices at lattice points
and whose legs, of lengths $m$ and $n$, lie along edges of the squares.
Let $S_1$ be the total area of the black part of the triangle
and $S_2$ be the total area of the white part.
Let $f(m,n) = | S_1 - S_2 |$.


\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \ii Calculate $f(m,n)$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$
  which are either both even or both odd.
  \ii Prove that $f(m,n) \leq \frac 12 \max \{m,n\}$ for all $m$ and $n$.
  \ii Show that there is no constant $C$
  such that $f(m,n) < C$ for all $ m$ and $ n$.
\end{enumerate}
