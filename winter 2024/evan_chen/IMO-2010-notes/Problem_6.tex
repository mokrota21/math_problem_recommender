Let $a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots$ be a sequence of positive real numbers, and $s$ be a positive integer, such that
\[
  a_n =
  \max \{ a_k + a_{n-k} \mid 1 \leq k \leq n-1 \}
  \text{ for all $n > s$}.
\]
Prove there exist positive integers $\ell \leq s$ and $N$, such that
\[
  a_n =
  a_{\ell} + a_{n - \ell} \text{ for all $n \ge N$}.
\]

\end{enumerate}
