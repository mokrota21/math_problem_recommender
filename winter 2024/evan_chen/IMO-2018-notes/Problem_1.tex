Let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of acute triangle $ABC$.
Points $D$ and $E$ lie on segments $AB$ and $AC$,
respectively, such that $AD = AE$.
The perpendicular bisectors of $\ol{BD}$ and $\ol{CE}$
intersect the minor arcs $AB$ and $AC$ of $\Gamma$
at points $F$ and $G$, respectively.
Prove that the lines $DE$ and $FG$ are parallel.
