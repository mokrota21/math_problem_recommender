In a mathematical competition some competitors are (mutual) friends.
Call a group of competitors a \emph{clique} if each two of them are friends.
Given that the largest size of a clique is even,
prove that the competitors can be arranged into two rooms
such that the largest size of a clique contained in one room
is the same as the largest size of a clique contained in the other room.
