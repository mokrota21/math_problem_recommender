In triangle $ABC$ the bisector of $\angle BCA$
meets the circumcircle again at $R$,
the perpendicular bisector of $\ol{BC}$ at $P$,
and the perpendicular bisector of $\ol{AC}$ at $Q$.
The midpoint of $\ol{BC}$ is $K$ and the midpoint of $\ol{AC}$ is $L$.
Prove that the triangles $RPK$ and $RQL$ have the same area.
