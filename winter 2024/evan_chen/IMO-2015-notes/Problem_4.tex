Triangle $ABC$ has circumcircle $\Omega$ and circumcenter $O$.
A circle $\Gamma$ with center $A$
intersects the segment $BC$ at points $D$ and $E$,
such that $B$, $D$, $E$, and $C$ are all different
and lie on line $BC$ in this order.
Let $F$ and $G$ be the points of intersection of $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$,
such that $A$, $F$, $B$, $C$, and $G$ lie on $\Omega$ in this order.
Let $K = (BDF) \cap \ol{AB} \neq B$
and $L = (CGE) \cap \ol{AC} \neq C$
and assume these points do not lie on line $FG$.
Define $X = \ol{FK} \cap \ol{GL}$.
Prove that $X$ lies on the line $AO$.
