We say that a finite set $\mathcal{S}$ of points in the plane
is \emph{balanced} if,
for any two different points $A$ and $B$ in $\mathcal{S}$,
there is a point $C$ in $\mathcal{S}$ such that $AC=BC$.
We say that $\mathcal{S}$ is \emph{centre-free} if for
any three different points $A$, $B$ and $C$ in $\mathcal{S}$,
there are no points $P$ in $\mathcal{S}$ such that $PA=PB=PC$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Show that for all integers $n\ge 3$,
  there exists a balanced set consisting of $n$ points.
\item[(b)] Determine all integers $n\ge 3$ for which
  there exists a balanced centre-free set consisting of $n$ points.
\end{enumerate}
