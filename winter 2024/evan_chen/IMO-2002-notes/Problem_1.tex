Let $n$ be a positive integer.
Let $T$ be the set of points $(x,y)$ in the plane
where $x$ and $y$ are non-negative integers with $x+y<n$.
Each point of $T$ is coloured red or blue,
subject to the following condition:
if a point $(x,y)$ is red,
then so are all points $(x',y')$ of $T$
with $x'\leq x$ and $y'\leq y$.
Let $A$ be the number of ways to choose $n$ blue points
with distinct $x$-coordinates,
and let $B$ be the number of ways to choose $n$ blue
points with distinct $y$-coordinates.
Prove that $A=B$.
