Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle BCA = 90\dg$,
and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$.
Let $X$ be a point in the interior of the segment $CD$.
Let $K$ be the point on the segment $AX$ such that $BK = BC$.
Similarly, let $L$ be the point on the segment $BX$ such that $AL = AC$.
Let $M = \ol{AL} \cap \ol{BK}$.
Prove that $MK = ML$.
