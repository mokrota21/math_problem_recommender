Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $J$ the center of the $A$-excircle.
This excircle is tangent to the side $BC$ at $M$,
and to the lines $AB$ and $AC$ at $K$ and $L$, respectively.
The lines $LM$ and $BJ$ meet at $F$, and the lines $KM$ and $CJ$ meet at $G$.
Let $S$ be the point of intersection of the lines $AF$ and $BC$,
and let $T$ be the point of intersection of the lines $AG$ and $BC$.
Prove that $M$ is the midpoint of $\ol{ST}$.
