Consider an integer $n > 1$, and a set $\mathcal S$ of $n$ points
in the plane such that the distance between any two different points
in $\mathcal S$ is at least $1$.
Prove there is a line $\ell$ separating $\mathcal S$
such that the distance from any point of $\mathcal S$ to $\ell$
is at least $\Omega(n^{-1/3})$.

(A line $\ell$ separates a set of points $S$
if some segment joining two points in $\mathcal S$ crosses $\ell$.)
