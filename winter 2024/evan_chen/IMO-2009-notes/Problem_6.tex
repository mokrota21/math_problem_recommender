Let $a_1$, $a_2$, \dots, $a_n$ be distinct positive integers and
let $M$ be a set of $n-1$ positive integers not containing $s = a_1 + \dots + a_n$.
A grasshopper is to jump along the real axis, starting at the point $0$ and
making $n$ jumps to the right with lengths $a_1$, $a_2$, \dots, $a_n$ in some order.
Prove that the order can be chosen in such a way that
the grasshopper never lands on any point in $M$.
