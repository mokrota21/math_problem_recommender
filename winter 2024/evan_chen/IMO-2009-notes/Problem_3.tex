Suppose that $s_1,s_2,s_3, \dotsc$ is a strictly increasing sequence of
positive integers such that the sub-sequences
$s_{s_1}$, $s_{s_2}$, $s_{s_3}$, \dots
and $s_{s_1 + 1}$, $s_{s_2 + 1}$, $s_{s_3 + 1}$, \dots
are both arithmetic progressions.
Prove that the sequence $s_1$, $s_2$, $s_3$, \dots\ is itself an arithmetic progression.
