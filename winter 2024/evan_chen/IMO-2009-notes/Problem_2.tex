Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcenter $O$.
The points $P$ and $Q$ are interior points of the sides $CA$ and $AB$ respectively.
Let $K$, $L$, $M$ be the midpoints of $\ol{BP}$, $\ol{CQ}$, $\ol{PQ}$,
respectively, and let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of $\triangle KLM$.
Suppose that $\ol{PQ}$ is tangent to $\Gamma$. Prove that $OP = OQ$.
