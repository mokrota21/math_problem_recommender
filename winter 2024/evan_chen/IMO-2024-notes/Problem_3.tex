Let $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, \dots\ be an infinite sequence of positive integers,
and let $N$ be a positive integer.
Suppose that, for each $n > N$,
the number $a_n$ is equal to the number of times $a_{n-1}$ appears
in the list $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{n-1})$.
Prove that at least one of the sequences $a_1$, $a_3$, $a_5$, \dots\
and $a_2$, $a_4$, $a_6$, \dots\ is eventually periodic.
