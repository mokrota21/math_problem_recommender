Let triangle $ABC$ with incenter $I$ satisfying $AB < AC < BC$.
Let $X$ be a point on line $BC$, different from $C$,
such that the line through $X$ and parallel to $AC$ is tangent to the incircle.
Similarly, let $Y$ be a point on line $BC$, different from $B$,
such that the line through $Y$ and parallel to $AB$ is tangent to the incircle.
Line $AI$ intersects the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ again at $P$.
Let $K$ and $L$ be the midpoints of $AC$ and $AB$, respectively.
Prove that $\angle KIL + \angle YPX = 180^{\circ}$.
