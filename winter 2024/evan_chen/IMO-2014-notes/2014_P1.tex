\begin{mdframed}[style=mdpurplebox,frametitle={Problem statement}]
Let $a_0 < a_1 < a_2 < \dotsb$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers.
Prove that there exists a unique integer $n\geq 1$ such that
\[ a_n < \frac{a_0+a_1+a_2+\dotsb+a_n}{n} \le a_{n+1}. \]
\end{mdframed}
Fedor Petrov presents the following nice solution.
Let us define the sequence
\[ b_n = \left( a_n - a_{n-1} \right) + \dots + \left( a_n - a_1 \right). \]
Since $(a_n)_n$ is increasing, we get $(b_n)_n$ is strictly increasing,
and moreover $b_1 = 0$.
The problem requires an $n$ such that
\[ b_n < a_0 \le b_{n+1} \]
which obviously exists and is unique.
