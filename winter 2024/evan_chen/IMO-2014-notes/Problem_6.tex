A set of lines in the plane is in \emph{general position}
if no two are parallel and no three pass through the same point.
A set of lines in general position cuts the plane into regions,
some of which have finite area; we call these its \emph{finite regions}.
Prove that for all sufficiently large $n$,
in any set of $n$ lines in general position
it is possible to colour at least $\sqrt{n}$ lines blue
in such a way that none of its finite regions
has a completely blue boundary.
