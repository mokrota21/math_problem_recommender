Let $P$ and $Q$ be on segment $BC$ of an acute triangle $ABC$
such that $\angle PAB=\angle BCA$ and $\angle CAQ=\angle ABC$.
Let $M$ and $N$ be points on $\ol{AP}$ and $\ol{AQ}$,
respectively, such that $P$ is the midpoint of $\ol{AM}$
and $Q$ is the midpoint of $\ol{AN}$.
Prove that $\ol{BM}$ and $\ol{CN}$ meet on the
circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$.
