a) $n^{5}-5n^{3}+4n$ is divisible by 120;

","Solution. a) $n^{5}-5n^{3}+4n=n(n^{2}-1)(n^{2}-4)$  

$$
=n(n-1)(n+1)(n-2)(n+2).
$$  

the product of five consecutive integers: $n-2$ , $n-1$ , $n$ , $n+1$ , $n+2$ .  

If $n\in\{-2,-1,0,1,2\}$ we get $n^{5}-5n^{3}+4n=0$ and the property holds If $n\geq3$ we can write  

$$
n^{5}-5n^{3}+4n=5!{\binom{n+2}{5}}=120{\binom{n+2}{5}},
$$  

and the conclusion follows.  

If $n\leq-3$ , write $n=-m$ , where $m\geq3$ , and obtain  

$$
n^{5}-5n^{3}+4n=-120{\binom{m+2}{5}},
$$  

and we are done.  

b) Observe that  

$$
n^{2}+3n+5=(n+7)(n-4)+33.
$$  

so that $11|n^{2}+3n+5$ if and only if $11|(n{+}7)(n{-}4)$ . Thus, if $11\div(n+7)(n-4)$ then 11 (and hence 121) does not divide $n^{2}+3n+5$ . So, assume 11 divides $(n+7)(n-4)$ . Then $11|n+7$ or $11|n-4$ ; but then 11 must divide both of $n+7$ and $n-4$ , since $(n+7)-(n-4)=11$ . Thus, $121|(n+7)(n-4)$ . However, $121\nmid33$ . So $121\uparrow n^{2}+3n+5=(n+7)(n-4)+33$ .

Lemma. If a and b are relatively prime positive integers, then there are positive integers u and v such that

a u-b v=1.
$$  

Proof. Consider the numbers  

$$
1\cdot2,\ 2\cdot a,\ldots,(b-1)\cdot a

When divided by $b$ the remainders of these numbers are distinct. Indeed, otherwise we have $k_{1}\neq k_{2}\in\{1,2,\ldots,b-1\}$ such that  

$$
k_{1}a=p_{1}b+r,\quad k_{2}a=p_{2}b+r
$$  

for some integers $p_{1},p_{2}$ . Hence  

$$
(k_{1}-k_{2})a=(p_{1}-p_{2})b\equiv0{\pmod{b}}.
$$  

Since $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime it follows that $|k_{1}-k_{2}|\equiv0$ (mod $b$ ), which is false because $1\leq|k_{1}-k_{2}|<b$ .  

On the other hand, none of the numbers listed in (1) is divisible by $b$ . Indeed, if so, then there is $k\in\{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$ such that  

$$
k\cdot a=p\cdot b{\mathrm{~for~some~integer~}}p.
$$  

Let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of $k$ and $p$ . Hence $k=k_{1}d$ , $p=p_{1}d$ , for some integers $p_{1},k_{1}$ with $g c d(p_{1},k_{1})=1$ . Then $k_{1}a=p_{1}b$ and since $g c d(a,b)=1$ , we have $k_{1}=b$ , $p_{1}=a$ . This is false, because $k_{1}<b$ .  

It follows that one of the numbers from (1) has the remainder 1 when divided by $b$ so there is $u\in\{1,2,\dotsc,b-1\}$ such that $a u=b v+1$ and the lemma is proved.

Because $g c d(a,b)=1$ using the lemma, there are positive integers $u$ and $v$ such that $a u-b v=1$ . Hence

(k_{1}-k_{2})a=(p_{1}-p_{2})b\equiv0{\pmod{b}}.
$$  

Since $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime it follows that $|k_{1}-k_{2}|\equiv0$ (mod $b$ ), which is false because $1\leq|k_{1}-k_{2}|<b$ .  

On the other hand, none of the numbers listed in (1) is divisible by $b$ . Indeed, if so, then there is $k\in\{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$ such that  

$$
k\cdot a=p\cdot b{\mathrm{~for~some~integer~}}p.
$$  

Let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of $k$ and $p$ . Hence $k=k_{1}d$ , $p=p_{1}d$ , for some integers $p_{1},k_{1}$ with $g c d(p_{1},k_{1})=1$ . Then $k_{1}a=p_{1}b$ and since $g c d(a,b)=1$ , we have $k_{1}=b$ , $p_{1}=a$ . This is false, because $k_{1}<b$ .  

It follows that one of the numbers from (1) has the remainder 1 when divided by $b$ so there is $u\in\{1,2,\dotsc,b-1\}$ such that $a u=b v+1$ and the lemma is proved.  

We prove now that the system  

$$
\left\{{\begin{array}{l}{a x-y z-c=0}\\ {b x-y t+d=0}\end{array}}\right.
$$  

with $a,b,c,d$ nonnegative integers and $g c d(a,b)=1$ has at least a solution in nonnegative integers.  

Because $g c d(a,b)=1$ using the lemma, there are positive integers $u$ and $v$ such that $a u-b v=1$ . Hence  

$$
x=c u+d v,\quad y=a d+b c,\quad z=v,\quad t=u,
$$  

is a solution to the system.

Let $g$ be the positive greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ . Then $g^{3}$ divides $a^{2}b$ , so $g^{3}$ divides $a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}$ , and $g$ divides $c$ . Thus, the gcd of any two of $a,b,c$ is the $g c d$ of all three.

$$
l^{2}m^{2}n^{2}|(l^{3}+m^{3}+n^{3}).

We will prove that $(l,m,n)$ is either (1,1,1) or a permutation of (1,2,3). Assume without loss of generality that $l\geq m\geq n$ . We have  

$$
3l^{3}\ge l^{3}+m^{3}+n^{3}\ge l^{2}m^{2}n^{2},

# Proposed problems  

","Problem. A table with m rows and n columns has all entries $-1$ or 1 such that for each row and each column the product of entries is $-1$ . Prove that m and n have the same parity.  

Solution. We compute the product $P$ of the $m\cdot n$ entries in two ways, by rows and by columns, respectively:  

$$
P=\underbrace{(-1)(-1)\dots(-1)}_{m\ t i m e s}=(-1)^{m}=(-1)^{n}=\underbrace{(-1)(-1)\dots(-1)}_{n\ t i m e s}.
$$  

The conclusion now follows.  

We will show such a table for $m=3$ and $n=5$ .

For $n\geq1$ , let $\boldsymbol a_{n+1}$ be the least integer greater than $a_{n}$ that is congruent to $-k$ modulo $p_{k+1}$ for all $k\leq n$ . Such an integer exists by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Thus, for all $k\geq0$ , $k+a_{n}\equiv0{\pmod{p_{k+1}}}$ for $n\geq k+1$ . Then at most $k+1$ values in the sequence $\left\{k+a_{n}\right\}$ can be prime; from the $k+2$ - th term onward, the values are nontrivial multiples of $p_{k+1}$ and must be composite. This completes the proof.

","Solution. Note that any product of any two numbers from $\{1,3,7,9\}$ taken modulo 20 is still in $\{1,3,7,9\}$ . Therefore any finite product of such numbers is still in this set. Specifically, any number of the form $3^{j}7^{k}$ is congruent to 1, 3, 7, or 9 (mod 20).

Solution. From the inequality $2(a^{2}+b^{2})\geq(a+b)^{2}$ we get $2n^{3}\geq n^{4}$ , that is $n\leq2$ . Thus:  

- for $n=0$ , we choose $a=b=0$ , - for $n=1$ , we take $a=1$ , $b=0$ and - for $n=2$ , we may take $a=b=2$ .

(1997 Rio Platense Mathematical Olympiad)  

","Solution. We refer to the digits of the number besides the two 97s as interior digits; the sum of these digits is $99-2(9+7)=67$ . Since each digit is at most 9, there are at least 8 such digits.  

Note that the sum of digits being 99 forces the number to be divisible by 9; thus it suffices to ensure that the number be divisible by 11, which is to say, the alternating sum of digits must be divisible by 11.  

Suppose the number has exactly 8 interior digits. If $a$ is the sum of the odd interior places and $b$ the sum of the even places, we have $a+b=67$ and $a-b\equiv-3$ (mod 11). Since $a-b$ must also be odd, we have $a-b\ge7$ or $a-b\leq-15$ , and so either $a\geq37$ or $b\geq41$ , contradicting the fact that $a$ and $b$ are each the sum of four digits.  

Now suppose the number has 9 interior digits. In this case, $a-b\equiv0$ (mod 11), so $a-b\geq11$ or $a-b\leq-11$ . In the latter case, $b\geq39$ , again a contradiction, but in the former case, we have $a\geq39$ , which is possible because $a$ is now the sum of five digits. To minimize the original number, we take the odd digits to be 3, 9, 9, 9, 9 and the even digits to be 1, 9, 9, 9, making the minimal number 9731999999997.

In the latter case, $b\geq39$ , again a contradiction, but in the former case, we have $a\geq39$ , which is possible because $a$ is now the sum of five digits. To minimize the original number, we take the odd digits to be 3, 9, 9, 9, 9 and the even digits to be 1, 9, 9, 9, making the minimal number 9731999999997.

Because $s_{1},s_{2},\ldots,s_{n}$ all have an even (resp. odd) number of digits, for each $i=1,2,\ldots,n-1$ , we can write $s_{i+1}=10^{2b}s_{i}+c$ for some integers $b>0$ and $0\leq c<10^{2b}$ . Because no $a_{i}$ equals $0$ , we further know that $0<c$ . Hence, by our lemma,

","Solution. All pairs $(1,p)$ , where $p$ is a prime number, satisfy the conditions. When $p=2$ , it follows $n=2$ and thus the pair $(2,2)$ is also a solution of the problem. Thus, we may suppose $p\geq3$ and let $n$ be such that $n\leq2p$ and $n^{p-1}$ divides $(p-1)^{n}+1$ . Since $(p-1)^{n}+1$ is odd number, it follows that $n<2p$ . We shall prove that $n=p$ .  

Let $q$ be a minimal prime divisor of $n$ . Since $q|n$ and $n^{p-1}|(p-1)^{n}+1$ , it follows $(p-1)^{n}\equiv-1$ (mod $q$ ). Since $n$ and $q-1$ are relatively prime numbers we may express $a n+b(q-1)=1$ .  

We have  

$$
p-1\equiv(p-1)^{a n+b(q-1)}\equiv(p-1)^{n a}(p-1)^{(q-1)b}\equiv(-1)^{a}1^{b}\equiv-1{\pmod{q}},
$$  

because $a$ must be odd. This shows that $q|p$ , and therefore $q=p$ . Since $n<2p$ , by the consideration of $q$ , we have $n=p$ .  

Let consider in these conditions the original divisibility:  

$$
p^{p-1}|(p-1)^{p}+1=p^{p}-{\binom{p}{1}}p^{p-1}+{\binom{p}{2}}p^{p-2}-\cdot\cdot\cdot+{\binom{p}{p-1}}p-1+1

$$
=p^{2}\left[p^{p-2}-{\binom{p}{1}}p^{p-3}+{\binom{p}{2}}p^{p-4}-\cdot\cdot\cdot+1\right].
$$  

Therefore $p-1=2$ , $p=3$ and then obtain the pair (3,3).  

The conclusion is: the required solutions are $(1,p)$ , $(2,2)$ and $(3,3)$ , where $p$ is an arbitrary prime.

Thus, we may suppose $p\geq3$ and let $n$ be such that $n\leq2p$ and $n^{p-1}$ divides $(p-1)^{n}+1$ . Since $(p-1)^{n}+1$ is odd number, it follows that $n<2p$ . We shall prove that $n=p$ .  

Let $q$ be a minimal prime divisor of $n$ . Since $q|n$ and $n^{p-1}|(p-1)^{n}+1$ , it follows $(p-1)^{n}\equiv-1$ (mod $q$ ). Since $n$ and $q-1$ are relatively prime numbers we may express $a n+b(q-1)=1$ .  

We have  

$$
p-1\equiv(p-1)^{a n+b(q-1)}\equiv(p-1)^{n a}(p-1)^{(q-1)b}\equiv(-1)^{a}1^{b}\equiv-1{\pmod{q}},
$$  

because $a$ must be odd. This shows that $q|p$ , and therefore $q=p$ . Since $n<2p$ , by the consideration of $q$ , we have $n=p$ .  

Let consider in these conditions the original divisibility:  

$$
p^{p-1}|(p-1)^{p}+1=p^{p}-{\binom{p}{1}}p^{p-1}+{\binom{p}{2}}p^{p-2}-\cdot\cdot\cdot+{\binom{p}{p-1}}p-1+1
$$  

$$
=p^{2}\left[p^{p-2}-{\binom{p}{1}}p^{p-3}+{\binom{p}{2}}p^{p-4}-\cdot\cdot\cdot+1\right].
$$  

Therefore $p-1=2$ , $p=3$ and then obtain the pair (3,3).  

The conclusion is: the required solutions are $(1,p)$ , $(2,2)$ and $(3,3)$ , where $p$ is an arbitrary prime.  

Remark. With a little bit more work, we can even erase the condition $n\leq2p$ .

","Solution. We prove the result by induction on $n$ . If $n=2$ , then $x=1$ suffices. Now suppose that the claim is true for $n\geq2$ , that is, there is a natural number $y$ such that $y^{3}+17$ is divisible by $3^{n}$ but not $3^{n+1}$ . We prove that the claim is true for $n+1$ .  

Suppose we have integers $a,m$ such that $a$ is not divisible by 3 and $m\geq2$ . Then $a^{2}\equiv1$ (mod 3) and thus $3^{m}a^{2}\equiv3^{m}$ (mod $3^{m+1}$ ). Also, because $m\geq2$ we have $3m-3\geq2m-1\geq m+1$ . Hence  

$$
(a+3^{m-1})^{3}\equiv a^{3}+3^{m}a^{2}+3^{2m-1}a+3^{3m-3}\equiv a^{3}+3^{m}{\pmod{3^{m+1}}}.
$$  

Because $y^{3}+17$ is divisible by $3^{n}$ , it is congruent to either $0$ , $3^{n}$ , or $2\cdot3^{n}$ modulo $3^{n+1}$ . Because 3 does not divide 17, 3 cannot divide $y$ either. Hence applying our result from the previous paragraph twice, once with $(a,m)=(y,n)$ and once with $(a,m)=(y+3^{n-1},n)$ , we find that $3^{n+1}$ must divide either $(y+3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ or $(y+2\cdot3^{n-1})^{3}+17$ .  

Hence there exists a natural number $x^{\prime}$ not divisible by 3 such that $3^{n+1}|{x^{\prime}}^{3}+17$ . If $3^{n+2}$ does not divide ${x^{\prime}}^{3}+17$ , we are done. Otherwise, we claim the number $x=x^{\prime}+3^{n}$ suffices. Because $x=x^{\prime}+3^{n-1}+3^{n-1}+3^{n-1}$ , the result from previous the paragraphs tells us that $x^{3}\equiv{x^{\prime}}^{3}+3^{n}+$ $3^{n}+3^{n}\equiv x^{\prime3}$ (mod $3^{n+1}$ ). Thus $3^{n+1}|x^{3}+17$ as well. On the other hand, because $x=x^{\prime}+3^{n}$ , we have $x^{3}\equiv{x^{\prime}}^{3}+3^{n+1}\not\equiv{x^{\prime}}^{3}$ (mod $3^{n+2}$ ). It follows that $3^{n+2}$ does not divide $x^{3}+17$ , as desired. This completes the inductive step.

Hence there exists a natural number $x^{\prime}$ not divisible by 3 such that $3^{n+1}|{x^{\prime}}^{3}+17$ . If $3^{n+2}$ does not divide ${x^{\prime}}^{3}+17$ , we are done. Otherwise, we claim the number $x=x^{\prime}+3^{n}$ suffices. Because $x=x^{\prime}+3^{n-1}+3^{n-1}+3^{n-1}$ , the result from previous the paragraphs tells us that $x^{3}\equiv{x^{\prime}}^{3}+3^{n}+$ $3^{n}+3^{n}\equiv x^{\prime3}$ (mod $3^{n+1}$ ). Thus $3^{n+1}|x^{3}+17$ as well. On the other hand, because $x=x^{\prime}+3^{n}$ , we have $x^{3}\equiv{x^{\prime}}^{3}+3^{n+1}\not\equiv{x^{\prime}}^{3}$ (mod $3^{n+2}$ ). It follows that $3^{n+2}$ does not divide $x^{3}+17$ , as desired. This completes the inductive step.

and let $M=M_{2}\cup M_{3}\cup M_{5}\cup M_{7}$ . The following cardinalities are obvious:  

$$
|M_{2}|=140,\quad|M_{3}|=93,\quad|M_{5}|=56\quad\mathrm{and}\quad|M_{7}|=40.

By the Pigeonhole Principle, any five-element subset of $M$ contains at least two elements from the same subset $M_{i}$ , $i\in\{2,3,5,7\}$ . These elements are not relatively prime numbers. Thus, we prove that $n>216$ .  

Second step. We will prove that $n=217$ .  

The set $S\setminus M$ contains $280-216=64$ elements. It contains prime numbers and composite numbers. Taking account that $[\sqrt{280}]=16$ , we may state that the composite numbers in $S\setminus M$ are precisely the elements of the set

Let $T$ be a subset containing 217 elements of $S$ . If $|T\cap P|\geq5$ it follows that $T$ contains 5 elements which are relatively prime numbers. So, let suppose $|T\cap P|\leq4$ . In this case, $|T\cap(S\setminus P)|\geq217-4=213$ . Since $S$ contains 220 composite numbers, it follows that at most 7 composite numbers are not in $T$ .  

Consider the following five-element subsets of $S\setminus P$ :

","Solution. If $f$ is completely multiplicative, we have  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{(f\ast f)(n)=\displaystyle\sum_{d\mid n}f(d)f\left({\frac{n}{d}}\right)=\sum_{d\mid n}f\left(d{\frac{n}{d}}\right)=\sum_{d\mid n}f(n)}\\ &{\qquad=f(n)\sum_{d\mid n}1=f(n)\tau(n)=(f\tau)(n),}\end{array}}
$$  

and the relation follows.  

Conversely, take $n\ =\ 1$ , and it follows $f(1)=0$ or $f(1)=1$ . Now suppose that $n\geq2$ and let $n=p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}\ldots p_{k}^{\alpha_{k}}$ the prime factorization of  

$n$ . Put $\alpha(n)=\alpha_{1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\alpha_{k}$ . It suffice to show that for any positive integer $n\geq2$ , the following relation holds  

$$
f(n)=f(1)f(p_{1})^{\alpha_{1}}\cdot\cdot\cdot f(p_{k})^{\alpha_{k}}.
$$  

We proceed by induction on $\alpha$ . If $\alpha(n)=1$ , then $n$ is a prime, say $n=p$ , and the property follows from the fact that  

$$
2f(p)=\tau(p)f(p)=f(1)f(p)+f(p)f(1)=2f(1)f(p)
$$  

Suppose then that the property holds for all $n$ with $\alpha(n)\leq k$ . Take any $n$ with $\alpha(n)=k+1$ . Then  

$$
\tau(n)f(n)=2f(1)f(n)+\sum f(a)f(b),
$$  

where the sum runs over all $a,b$ with $a b=n$ and $1<a,b<n$ . It follows that $\alpha(a)\leq k$ , $\alpha(b)\leq k$ and from the inductive assumption we get  

$$
\tau(n)f(n)=2f(1)f(n)+(\tau(n)-2)f^{2}(1)f(p_{1})^{\alpha_{1}}\cdot\cdot\cdot f(p_{k})^{\alpha_{k}}
$$  

Since $n$ is not a prime, certainly $\tau(n)>2$ and so, for both $f(1)=0$ and $f(1)=1$ , the desired result follows.

Solution. Take $k=2\cdot7^{m}$ , $m\geq1$ . If $n=p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}\ldots{}p_{h}^{\alpha_{h}}$ , then  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\varphi(n)=p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p_{1}}\right)\cdot\cdot\cdot p_{h}^{\alpha_{h}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p_{h}}\right)}\\ {=p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}-1}\cdot\cdot\cdot p_{h}^{\alpha_{h}-1}(p_{1}-1)\cdot\cdot\cdot(p_{h}-1).}\end{array}

If at least two of the primes $p_{1},\ldots,p_{h}$ are odd, then $4|\varphi(n)$ and $\varphi(n)\neq k$ . If $n=2^{\alpha}p^{\beta}$ , with $p\geq3$ , then  

$$
\varphi(n)=2^{\alpha}p^{\beta}\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)=2^{\alpha-1}p^{\beta-1}(p-1).
$$  

In this case the equality $\varphi(n)=k$ is also impossible.

(1997 Ukrainean Mathematical Olympiad)  

","Solution. The minimum is $n=35$ ; the 34-element set of 17 zeroes and 17 ones shows that $n\geq35$ , so it remains to show that among 35 integers, there are 18 whose sum is divisible by 18. In fact, one can show that for any $n$ , among $2n-1$ integers there are $n$ whose sum is divisible by $n$ .  

We show this claim by induction on $n$ ; it’s clear for $n=1$ . If $n$ is composite, say $n=p q$ , we can assemble sets of $p$ integers whose sum is divisible by $p$ as long as at least $2p-1$ numbers remain; this gives $2q-1$ sets, and again by the induction hypothesis, some $q$ of these have sum divisible by $q$ .  

Now suppose $n=p$ is prime. The number $x$ is divisible by $p$ if and only if $x^{p-1}\not\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). Thus if the claim is false, then the sum of $(a_{1}+$ $\cdots+a_{p})^{p-1}$ over all subsets $\{a_{1},\ldots,a_{p}\}$ of the given numbers is congruent to ${\binom{2p-1}{p-1}}\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). On the other hand, the sum of $a_{1}^{e_{1}}\dots a_{p}^{e_{p}}$ for $e_{1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+e_{p}\leq p-1$ is always divisible by $p$ : if $k\le p-1$ of the $e_{i}$ are nonzero, then each product is repeated $\binom{2p-1-k}{p-k}$ times, and the latter is a multiple of $p$ . This contradiction shows that the claim holds in this case. (Note: to solve the original problem, of course it suffices to prove the cases $p=2,3$ directly).  

Remark. The fact that for any $n$ , among $2n-1$ integers there are $n$ whose sum is divisible by $n$ is a famous theorem of Erdo¨s and Ginzburg.

For $n=1$ , note that any two consecutive terms in the sequence are relatively prime. For $n>1$ , let $N$ be the product of the numbers in the set so far; then $a^{\varphi(N)+1}+a^{\varphi(N)}-1\equiv a$ (mod $N$ ), and so can be added (since every element of the sequence is coprime to $a$ , $N$ is as well).

","Solution. In fact, every integer that is not divisible by 10 divides some element of $X$ . We first note that there exists a multiple of $4^{p}$ in $X$ with $2p-1$ digits for all nonnegative integer $p$ . This follows by induction on $p$ : it’s obvious for $p=0,1$ , and if $x$ is such a multiple for $p=k$ , then we can choose $a_{2k}$ so that $x+a_{2k}10^{2k}\equiv0$ (mod $4^{k+1}$ ) since $10^{2k}\equiv0{\pmod{4^{k}}}$ ).  

Now we proceed to show that any integer $n$ that isn’t divisible by 10 divides some element of $X$ . Let $n=2^{p}k$ , where $k$ is odd. Then by the lemma above one can find a multiple of $2^{p}$ in $X$ . Let $m$ be the multiple, $d$ be the number of digits of $m$ , and $f=10^{d+1}-1$ . By Euler’s Theorem, $10^{\varphi(f k)}\equiv1_{}$ (mod $f k$ ). Therefore $m(10^{(d+1)\varphi(f k)}-1)/(10^{d+1}-1)$ is divisible by $2^{p}k$ and lies in $X$ (since it is the concatenation of $m$ ’s).

# ","Solution.  

a) is straightforward. In fact, we will prove that any prime factor of $f_{p}(m)$ is relatively prime with $m(m-1)$ . Take such a prime divisor $q$ . Because $q|1+m+\cdot\cdot\cdot+m^{p-1}$ , it is clear that $g c d(q,m)=1$ . Moreover, if $g c d(q,m-1)\neq1$ , then $q|m-1$ and because $q|1+m+\cdot\cdot\cdot+m^{p-1}$ , it follows that $q|p$ . But $p|m$ and we find that $q|m$ , which is clearly impossible.

So, let us take a prime $q|f_{p}(m)$ for a certain positive integer $m$ divisible by $p$ . Then we have of course $q|m^{p}-1$ . But this implies that $o_{\boldsymbol q}(m)|\boldsymbol q$ and consequently $o_{q}(m)\in\{1,p\}$ . If $o_{q}(m)~=~p$ , then $q\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). Otherwise, $q|m-$

","Solution. When $y=1$ the left-hand side is $0$ . Thus we can rewrite our equation as  

$$
x={\frac{y(y-1)+c}{(y+1)(y-1)}}.
$$  

The numerator is congruent to $-1(-2)+c$ modulo $(y+1)$ , and it is also congruent to $c$ modulo $(y-1)$ . Hence we must have $c\equiv-2$ (mod $(y+1)$ ) and $c\equiv0$ (mod $(y-1)$ ). Because $c=y-1$ satisfies these congruences, we must have $c\equiv y-1$ (mod $\operatorname{lcm}(y-1,y+1),$ ). When $y$ is even, $\mathrm{lcm}(y-$ $1,y+1)=y^{2}-1$ ; when $y$ is odd, $\operatorname{lcm}(y-1,y+1)={\frac{1}{2}}(y^{2}-1)$ .  

Then for $y=2,3,11$ we have $c\equiv1$ (mod 3), $c\equiv2$ (mod 4), $c\equiv10$ (mod 60). Hence, we try setting $c=10$ . For $x$ to be an integer we must have $(y-1)|10\ \Rightarrow\ y=2,3,6$ , or 11. These values give $x=4,2,\frac{2}{7}$ , and 1, respectively.

","Solution. Suppose by way of contradiction that such numbers exist. Assume without loss of generality that $x,y,z$ are nonnegative integers.

","Solution. The idea of the solution is to find a non-singular change of coordinates with integer coefficients  

$$
(x,y)\to(a x+b y,c x+d y),
$$  

such that the polynomial $x^{3}-3x y^{2}+y^{3}$ does not change after changing coordinates. Such a transformation can be found after remarking the identity:  

$$
x^{3}-3x y^{2}+y^{3}=(y-x)^{3}-3x^{2}y+2x^{3}=(y-x)^{3}-3(y-x)x^{2}+(-x)^{3}.
$$  

Thus, such a transformation is $T(x,y)=(y-x,-x)$ . It can be represented like a linear transformation  

$$
T\left(\begin{array}{c}{x}\\ {y}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c c}{-1}&{1}\\ {-1}&{0}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}{x}\\ {y}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}{-x+y}\\ {-x}\end{array}\right).
$$  

We have  

$$
T^{2}={\left(\begin{array}{l l}{-1}&{1}\\ {-1}&{0}\end{array}\right)}{\left(\begin{array}{l l}{-1}&{1}\\ {-1}&{0}\end{array}\right)}={\left(\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{-1}\\ {1}&{-1}\end{array}\right)}
$$  

and  

$$
T^{3}={\left(\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{-1}\\ {1}&{-1}\end{array}\right)}{\left(\begin{array}{l l}{-1}&{1}\\ {-1}&{0}\end{array}\right)}={\left(\begin{array}{l l}{1}&{0}\\ {0}&{1}\end{array}\right)}.
$$  

Thus, $T^{2}(x,y)=(-y,x-y)$ . Moreover, it is easy to see that if $x^{3}-$ $3x y^{2}+y^{3}=n$ , $n\geq0$ , then the pairs $(x,y)$ , $(-y,x-y)$ are distinct.  

For the second part, observe that $2819=7^{2}\cdot59$ . Suppose that $x,y$ are integer numbers such that $x^{3}-3x y^{2}+y^{3}=2891$ . Then $x,y$ are pairwise prime, because from $d=(x,y)$ we obtain $d^{3}\vert2891$ . The numbers $x,y$ are not divisible by 7, then they are inversible modulo 7. Thus, from the equation we obtain  

$$
\left({\frac{y}{x}}\right)^{3}-3\left({\frac{y}{x}}\right)^{2}+1\equiv0{\pmod{7}}.
$$  

This proves that the congruence  

$$
a^{3}-3a^{2}+1\equiv0{\pmod{7}}
$$  

has a solution, $a\in\mathbb{Z}$ . Since 7 is not a divisor of $a$ , by Fermat’s Little Theorem one has $a^{6}\equiv1$ (mod 7). There are two possibilities: $a^{3}\equiv1$ (mod 7) or $a^{3}\equiv-1$ (mod 7). When $\boldsymbol{a}^{3}\equiv1$ (mod 7) we obtain:  

$$
a^{3}-3a^{2}+1\equiv0{\pmod{7}}\Rightarrow3a^{2}\equiv2{\pmod{7}}\Rightarrow a^{2}\equiv3{\pmod{7}}.

$$
\left({\frac{3}{7}}\right)=(-1)^{{\frac{3-1}{2}}\cdot{\frac{7-1}{2}}}\left({\frac{7}{3}}\right)=(-1)\left({\frac{1}{3}}\right)=-1.
$$  

This proves that 3 is not a square modulo 7. When $a^{3}\equiv-1$ (mod 7) we obtain the contradiction from: $3a^{2}\equiv0$ (mod 7). Thus, the equation $x^{3}-3x y^{2}+y^{3}=2891$ has no solution in integers $(x,y)$ .

\left({\frac{3}{7}}\right)=(-1)^{{\frac{3-1}{2}}\cdot{\frac{7-1}{2}}}\left({\frac{7}{3}}\right)=(-1)\left({\frac{1}{3}}\right)=-1.
$$  

This proves that 3 is not a square modulo 7. When $a^{3}\equiv-1$ (mod 7) we obtain the contradiction from: $3a^{2}\equiv0$ (mod 7). Thus, the equation $x^{3}-3x y^{2}+y^{3}=2891$ has no solution in integers $(x,y)$ .

$$
A=\frac{(m+3)^{n}+1}{3m}
$$  

is an integer. Prove that $A$ is odd.  

(1998 Bulgarian Mathematical Olympiad)  

","Solution. If $m$ is odd, then $(m+3)^{n}+1$ is odd and $A$ is odd. Now we suppose that $m$ is even. Since $A$ is an integer,  

$$
0\equiv(m+3)^{n}+1\equiv m^{n}+1{\pmod{3}},\qquad
$$  

so $n=2k+1$ is odd and $m\equiv-1$ (mod 3). We consider the following cases. (a) $m=8m^{\prime}$ for some positive integer $m^{\prime}$ . Then  

$$
(m+3)^{n}+1\equiv3^{2k+1}+1\equiv4{\pmod{8}}
$$  

and $3m\equiv0$ (mod 8). So $A$ is not an integer.  

(b) $m=2m^{\prime}$ for some odd positive integer $m^{\prime}$ , i.e., $m\equiv2$ (mod 4). Then  

$$
(m+3)^{n}+1\equiv(2+3)+1\equiv2{\pmod{4}}
$$  

and $3m\equiv2$ (mod 4). So $A$ is odd.  

(c) $m=4m^{\prime}$ for some odd positive integer $m^{\prime}$ . Because $m\equiv-1$ (mod 3), there exists an odd prime $p$ such that $p\equiv-1$ (mod 3) and $p|m$ . Since $A$ is an integer,  

$$
0\equiv(m+3)^{n}+1\equiv3^{2k+1}+1{\pmod{m}}
$$  

and $3^{2k+1}\equiv-1$ (mod $p$ ). Let $a$ be a primitive root modulo $p$ ; let $b$ be a positive integer such that $3\equiv a^{b}$ (mod $p$ ). Thus $a^{(2k+1)b}\equiv-1$ (mod $p$ ). Note that $(p/3)=(-1/3)=-1$ . We consider the following cases.  

(i) $p\equiv1$ (mod 4). From the Quadratic Reciprocity Law, $(-1/p)=1$ , so  

$$
a^{2c}\equiv-1\equiv a^{(2k+1)b}{\pmod{p}}
$$  

for some positive integer $c$ . Therefore $b$ is even and $(3/p)=1$ . Again, from the Quadratic Reciprocity Law,  

$$
-1=(3/p)(p/3)=(-1)^{(3-1)(p-1)/4}=1,
$$  

a contradiction.  

(ii) $p\equiv3$ (mod 4). From the Quadratic Reciprocity Law, $(-1/p)=-1$ , so  

$$
a^{2c+1}\equiv-1\equiv a^{(2k+1)b}{\pmod{p}}
$$  

for some positive integer $c$ . Therefore $b$ is odd and $(3/p)=-1$ . Again, from the Quadratic Reciprocity Law,  

$$
1=(3/p)(p/3)=(-1)^{(3-1)(p-1)/4}=-1,
$$

Thus for $m=4m^{\prime}$ and $m^{\prime}$ is odd, $A$ is not an integer.  

From the above, we see that if $A$ is an integer, $A$ is odd.

Solution. If $m$ is odd, then $(m+3)^{n}+1$ is odd and $A$ is odd. Now we suppose that $m$ is even. Since $A$ is an integer,  

$$
0\equiv(m+3)^{n}+1\equiv m^{n}+1{\pmod{3}},\qquad
$$  

so $n=2k+1$ is odd and $m\equiv-1$ (mod 3). We consider the following cases. (a) $m=8m^{\prime}$ for some positive integer $m^{\prime}$ . Then  

$$
(m+3)^{n}+1\equiv3^{2k+1}+1\equiv4{\pmod{8}}

and $3m\equiv0$ (mod 8). So $A$ is not an integer.  

(b) $m=2m^{\prime}$ for some odd positive integer $m^{\prime}$ , i.e., $m\equiv2$ (mod 4). Then  

$$

and $3^{2k+1}\equiv-1$ (mod $p$ ). Let $a$ be a primitive root modulo $p$ ; let $b$ be a positive integer such that $3\equiv a^{b}$ (mod $p$ ). Thus $a^{(2k+1)b}\equiv-1$ (mod $p$ ). Note that $(p/3)=(-1/3)=-1$ . We consider the following cases.  

(i) $p\equiv1$ (mod 4). From the Quadratic Reciprocity Law, $(-1/p)=1$ , so  

$$
a^{2c}\equiv-1\equiv a^{(2k+1)b}{\pmod{p}}

for some positive integer $c$ . Therefore $b$ is even and $(3/p)=1$ . Again, from the Quadratic Reciprocity Law,  

$$
-1=(3/p)(p/3)=(-1)^{(3-1)(p-1)/4}=1,
$$  

a contradiction.  

(ii) $p\equiv3$ (mod 4). From the Quadratic Reciprocity Law, $(-1/p)=-1$ , so  

$$
a^{2c+1}\equiv-1\equiv a^{(2k+1)b}{\pmod{p}}

for some positive integer $c$ . Therefore $b$ is odd and $(3/p)=-1$ . Again, from the Quadratic Reciprocity Law,  

$$
1=(3/p)(p/3)=(-1)^{(3-1)(p-1)/4}=-1,

","Solution. Using the result of the previous problem, we deduce that $2^{n}{+1}$ does not have prime divisors of the form $8k+7$ . We will prove that if $n$ is odd, then it has no prime divisors of the form $8k+5$ either. Indeed, let $p$ + be a prime divisor of $2^{n}+1$ . Then $2^{n}\equiv-1$ (mod $p$ ) and so $-2\equiv(2^{\frac{n+1}{2}})^{2}$ (mod $p$ ). Using the same argument as the one in the previous problem, we deduce that $\frac{p^{2}-1}{8}+\frac{p-1}{2}$ is even, which cannot happen if $p$ is of the form $8k+5$ .  

Now, let us solve the proposed problem. We will assume $n>2$ (otherwise the verification is trivial). The essential observation is the identity:

$$

$$  

Indeed, assume that $p$ is a prime number dividing $g c d(2^{2\cdot3^{i}}-2^{3^{i}}+$ $1,2^{2\cdot3^{j}}-2^{3^{j}}+1)$ We will then have $p|2^{3^{i+1}}+1$ . Thus,  

$$
2^{3^{j}}\equiv{\bigl(2^{3^{i+1}}\bigr)}^{3^{j-i-1}}\equiv{\bigl(-1\bigr)}^{3^{j-i-1}}\equiv-1{\pmod{p}},

implying  

$$

This cannot happen unless $p=3$ . But since  

$$
v_{3}(g c d(2^{2\cdot3^{i}}-2^{3^{i}}+1,2^{2\cdot3^{j}}-2^{3^{j}}+1))=1

(as one can immediately check), it follows that

It would follow in this case that $2^{3^{\prime\prime}}+1$ has at least $n-1$ distinct prime divisors of the form $8k+3$ (from the previous remarks) and since it is also divisible by 3, the conclusion would follow. Fix $i\in\{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$ and observe that any prime factor of $2^{2\cdot3^{\circ}}-2^{3^{\circ}}+1$ is also a prime factor of $2^{3^{\prime\prime}}+1$ and thus, from the first remark, it must be of the form $8k+1$ or $8k+3$ . Because $v_{3}(2^{2\cdot3^{\circ}}-2^{3^{\circ}}+1)=1$ , it follows that if all prime divisors of $2^{2\cdot3^{\circ}}-2^{3^{\circ}}+1$ except for 3 are of the form $8k+1$ , then $2^{2\cdot3^{\iota}}-2^{3^{\iota}}+1\equiv8$ (mod 8), which is clearly impossible. Thus at least a prime divisor of $2^{2\cdot3^{\imath}}-2^{3^{\imath}}+1$ is different from 3 and is of the form $8k+3$ and so the claim is proved. The conclusion follows.

(1997 Asian-Pacific Mathematical Olympiad)  

","Solution. The first step would be choosing $n=2p$ , for some prime number $p$ . Unfortunately this cannot work by Fermat’s little theorem. So let us try setting $n=2p q$ , with $p,q$ different prime numbers. We need $p q|2^{2p q-1}+1$ and so we must have $\left({\frac{-2}{p}}\right)\ =\ \left({\frac{-2}{q}}\right)\ =\ 1$ . Also, using Fermat’s little theorem, $p|2^{2q-1}+1$ and $q|2^{2p-1}+1$ . A small verification shows that $q=\mathrm{3},\mathrm{5},\mathrm{7}$ are not good choices, so let us try $q=11$ . In this case we find $p=43$ and so it suffices to show that $p q|2^{2p q-1}+1$ for $q=11$ and $p\ =\ 43$ . This is immediate, since the hard work has already been completed: we have shown that it suffices to have $p|q^{2q-1}$ , $q|2^{2p-1}+1$ , and $\left({\frac{-2}{p}}\right)=\left({\frac{-2}{q}}\right)=1$ in order to have $p q|2^{2p q-1}+1$ . But as one can easily check, all these conditions are verified and the number $2\cdot11\cdot43$ is a valid answer.

So let us try setting $n=2p q$ , with $p,q$ different prime numbers. We need $p q|2^{2p q-1}+1$ and so we must have $\left({\frac{-2}{p}}\right)\ =\ \left({\frac{-2}{q}}\right)\ =\ 1$ . Also, using Fermat’s little theorem, $p|2^{2q-1}+1$ and $q|2^{2p-1}+1$ . A small verification shows that $q=\mathrm{3},\mathrm{5},\mathrm{7}$ are not good choices, so let us try $q=11$ . In this case we find $p=43$ and so it suffices to show that $p q|2^{2p q-1}+1$ for $q=11$ and $p\ =\ 43$ . This is immediate, since the hard work has already been completed: we have shown that it suffices to have $p|q^{2q-1}$ , $q|2^{2p-1}+1$ , and $\left({\frac{-2}{p}}\right)=\left({\frac{-2}{q}}\right)=1$ in order to have $p q|2^{2p q-1}+1$ . But as one can easily check, all these conditions are verified and the number $2\cdot11\cdot43$ is a valid answer.

$$

By squaring the congruence $2^{2^{n}}\equiv-1$ (mod $p$ ) we get $2^{2^{n+1}}\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ), hence $i|2^{n+1}$ , that is $i=2^{k}$ for some nonnegative integer $k$ .

Consider ordered pairs of consecutive Fibonacci numbers $(F_{0},F_{1})$ , $(F_{1},F_{2}),\ldots$ . taken modulo $n$ . Because the Fibonacci sequence is infinite and there are only $n^{2}$ possible ordered pairs of integers modulo $n$ , two such pairs $(F_{j},F_{j+1})$ must be congruent: $F_{i}\equiv F_{i+m}$ and $F_{i+1}\equiv F_{i+m+1}$ (mod $n$ ) for some $i$ and $m$ .

However, all perfect squares are $0$ or $^{1}$ (mod 4), so at most two terms ( $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ ) can be perfect squares. If $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ are both perfect squares, then writing $a_{1}=a^{2}$ , $a_{2}=b^{2}$ we have $a^{6}+1999=b^{2}$ or $1999=b^{2}-(a^{3})^{2}=$ $(b+a^{3})(b-a^{3})$ . Because 1999 is prime, $b-a^{3}=1$ and $b+a^{3}=1999$ . Thus $a^{3}={\frac{1999-1}{2}}=999$ , which is impossible. Hence at most one term of the sequence is a perfect square.

Using an argument involving prime factorizations, we will prove the more general assertion that for each $k<n$ , $\operatorname{lcm}(n,n-1,\dots,n-k)$ is divisible by $n{\binom{n-1}{k}}$  

Let $k$ and $n$ be fixed natural numbers with $k<n$ , and let $p\leq n$ be an arbitrary prime. Let $p^{\alpha}$ be the highest power of $p$ which divides $\operatorname{lcm}(n,n-$ $1,\ldots,n-k)$ , where $p^{\alpha}|n-l$ for some $l$ . Then for each $i\le\alpha$ , we know that $p^{i}|n-l$ . Thus exactly $\left\lfloor{\frac{l}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor$ of $\{n-l+1,n-l+2,\ldots,n\}$ and exactly $\left\lfloor{\frac{k-l}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor$ of $\{n-l-1,n-l-2,\ldots,n-k\}$ are multiples of $p^{i}$ , so $p^{i}$ divides $\left\lfloor{\frac{l}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor{\frac{k-l}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor\leq\left\lfloor{\frac{k}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor$ of the remaining $k$ numbers, that is, at most the number of multiples of $p^{i}$ between 1 and $k$ . It follows that $p$ divides  

$$
n{\binom{n-1}{k}}={\frac{n(n-1)\dots(n-l+1)(n-l-1)\dots(n-k)}{k!}}(n-l)
$$  

at most $\alpha$ times, so that indeed $n{\binom{n-1}{k}}|\mathrm{lcm}(n,n-1,\dots,n-k)$ .

for some positive integers $x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4},x_{5}$ .  

(2002 Belarussian Mathematical Olympiad)  

Solution. For each integer $N$ , we consider the number of integers in $[1,N]$ that can be written in the above form. Because $x_{1}\leq N^{\frac{1}{3}}$ , there are at most $N^{\frac{1}{3}}$ ways to choose $x_{1}$ . Similar argument applies to the other $x_{i}\mathrm{s}$ . Therefore, there are at most $N^{\frac{1}{3}}N^{\frac{1}{5}}N^{\frac{1}{7}}N^{\frac{1}{9}}N^{\frac{1}{11}}=N^{\frac{3043}{3465}}$ combinations. So there are at least $N-N^{\frac{3043}{3465}}$ integers not covered. It is easy to see that this value can be arbitrarily large as $N$ approaches infinity. Therefore, there exist infinitely many positive integers that cannot be written in the form $x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{5}+x_{3}^{7}+x_{4}^{9}+x_{5}^{11}$ .

(2001 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  

","Solution. We will call a number ”good” if it satisfies the given conditions. It is not difficult to see that all prime powers are good. Suppose $n$ is a good number that has at least two distinct prime factors. Let $n=p^{r}s$ , where $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $n$ and $s$ is not divisible by $p$ . Because $n$ is good, $p+s-1$ must divide $n$ . For any prime $q$ dividing $s$ , $s<p+s-1<s+q$ , so $q$ does not divide $p+s-1$ . Therefore, the only prime factor of $p+s-1$ is $p$ . Then $s=p^{c}-p+1$ for some $c>1$ . Because $p^{c}$ must also divide $n$ , $p^{c}+s-1=2p^{c}-p$ divides $n$ . Because $2p^{c-1}-1$ has no factors of $p$ , it must divide $s$ . But a simple computation shows that $\frac{p-1}{2}<\frac{p^{c}-p+1}{2p^{c-1}-1}<\frac{p+1}{2}$ , therefore $2p^{c-1}-1$ cannot divide $s$ .

(1998 Romanian IMO Team Selection Test)  

Solution. The solutions are $(x,n)=(4,1)$ and (11,1). If $n=1$ , we need $x+3=x+2+1|x^{2}+4+1=x^{2}+5=(x+3)(x-3)+14$ , so $x+3$ divides 14 and $x=4$ or 11. Suppose $n\geq2$ . For $x\in\{1,2,3\}$ we have  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{1+2^{n}+1<1+2^{n+1}+1<2(1+2^{n}+1),}}\\ {{}}\\ {{2^{n}+2^{n}+1<2^{n+1}+2^{n+1}+1<2(2^{n}+2^{n}+1)}}\end{array}
$$  

$$
2(3^{n}+2^{n}+1)<3^{n+1}+2^{n+1}+1<3(3^{n}+2^{n}+1),
$$  

so $x^{n}+2^{n}+1$ does not divide $x^{n+1}+2^{n+1}+1$ . For $x\geq4$ , $x^{n}=x^{n}/2+x^{n}/2\geq$ $2^{2n}/2+x^{2}/2$ , so  

$$
(2^{n}+1)x\leq((2^{n}+1)^{2}+x^{2})/2

$$

Therefore

","Solution. There are several constructions for such $A$ , involving different ideas about the decomposition of integer numbers.  

First example. Let $p_{1}<p_{2}<\cdot\cdot\cdot<p_{n}<...$ be the increasing sequence of all prime numbers. Define $A$ being the set of numbers of the form $p_{i_{1}}p_{i_{2}}\ldots p_{i_{k}}$ where $i_{1}<i_{2}<\cdots<i_{k}$ and $i_{k}\ =\ p_{i_{1}}$ . For example $3\cdot5\cdot7\in A$ ; $3\cdot11\cdot13\in A$ and $5\cdot7\cdot11\notin A$ ; $3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot11\notin A$ .  

We will see that $A$ satisfies the required condition. Let $S$ be an infinite set of prime numbers, say $q_{1}<q_{2}<\cdot\cdot\cdot<q_{n}<...$ . Take $m=q_{1}q_{2}\ldots q_{q_{1}}$ and $n=q_{1}q_{2}\ldots q_{q_{1}+1}$ . Then $m\in A$ and $n\not\in A$ .  

Second example. Define $A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}$ where $A_{i}$ is the set of numbers which are product of $i+1$ distinct primes which are different from $p_{i}$ . For example $3\cdot5\cdot7\in A_{2}$ , $2\cdot3\cdot7\cdot11\in A_{3}$ and $2\cdot3\cdot7\notin A_{2}$ , $3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot13\notin A_{3}$ .  

Let $S$ be an infinite set of prime numbers, say $q_{1}<q_{2}<\cdot\cdot\cdot<q_{n}<...$ Suppose that $q_{1}=p_{i_{1}}$ . If $i_{1}>1$ , note $i_{1}=k$ . Then $n=q_{1}q_{2}\ldots q_{k+1}\notin$  

$A$ , because it contains prime factor $q_{1}~=~p_{i_{1}}=p_{k}$ . The number $m=$ $q_{2}q_{3}\ldots q_{k+2}$ contains $k+1$ factors, all different from $p_{k}=q_{1}$ . Thus $m\in A$ . If $i_{1}=1$ , take $k=i_{2}$ and the same construction will answer the question.  

Third example. Let $P$ be the set of all positive primes and let $P_{1}\subset$ $P_{2}\subset\cdots\subset P_{n}\subset\ldots.$ be an ascending chain of finite distinct subsets of $P$ , such that $P=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}P_{i}$ . Define $A$ to be the set of elements of the form  

$$
a=p_{1}p_{2}\ldots p_{k}
$$  

$k=i_{1}<i_{2}<\cdot\cdot\cdot<i_{k}$ and $p_{1}\in P_{i_{1}}\setminus P_{i_{1}-1}$ , $p_{2}\in P_{i_{2}},...,p_{k}\in P_{i_{k}}$ .  

Let $S$ be an infinite set of prime numbers and let $S_{i}=S\cap P_{i}$ . It is obvious that $S_{1}\subset S_{2}\subset\cdots\subset S_{n}\subset\ldots.$ This chain is not stationary because $S=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}S_{i}$ . Then, it contains an infinite subchain with distinct sets:  

$$
S_{i_{1}}\subset S_{i_{2}}\subset\cdots\subset S_{i_{n}}\subset\ldots.
$$  

Suppose that $S_{i_{n}}=S_{i_{n+1}}=\cdot\cdot\cdot=S_{i_{n+1}-1}\subset S_{i_{n+1}}$ . Set $i_{1}=k>1$ and choose $p_{1}\in S_{i_{1}}\setminus S_{i_{1}-1}$ , $p_{2}\in S_{i_{2}}\setminus S_{i_{2}-1},...$ , $p_{k}\in S_{i_{k}}\setminus S_{i_{k}-1}$ and $p_{k+1}\in S_{i_{k+1}}\setminus S_{i_{k}}$ . Then $m=p_{1}p_{2}\ldots p_{k}\in A$ and $n=p_{2}p_{3}\ldots p_{k+1}\notin A$ because $p_{2}\notin S_{i_{1}}=S_{k}$ .

Second example. Define $A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}$ where $A_{i}$ is the set of numbers which are product of $i+1$ distinct primes which are different from $p_{i}$ . For example $3\cdot5\cdot7\in A_{2}$ , $2\cdot3\cdot7\cdot11\in A_{3}$ and $2\cdot3\cdot7\notin A_{2}$ , $3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot13\notin A_{3}$ .  

Let $S$ be an infinite set of prime numbers, say $q_{1}<q_{2}<\cdot\cdot\cdot<q_{n}<...$ Suppose that $q_{1}=p_{i_{1}}$ . If $i_{1}>1$ , note $i_{1}=k$ . Then $n=q_{1}q_{2}\ldots q_{k+1}\notin$  

$A$ , because it contains prime factor $q_{1}~=~p_{i_{1}}=p_{k}$ . The number $m=$ $q_{2}q_{3}\ldots q_{k+2}$ contains $k+1$ factors, all different from $p_{k}=q_{1}$ . Thus $m\in A$ . If $i_{1}=1$ , take $k=i_{2}$ and the same construction will answer the question.  

Third example. Let $P$ be the set of all positive primes and let $P_{1}\subset$ $P_{2}\subset\cdots\subset P_{n}\subset\ldots.$ be an ascending chain of finite distinct subsets of $P$ , such that $P=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}P_{i}$ . Define $A$ to be the set of elements of the form  

$$
a=p_{1}p_{2}\ldots p_{k}
$$  

$k=i_{1}<i_{2}<\cdot\cdot\cdot<i_{k}$ and $p_{1}\in P_{i_{1}}\setminus P_{i_{1}-1}$ , $p_{2}\in P_{i_{2}},...,p_{k}\in P_{i_{k}}$ .  

Let $S$ be an infinite set of prime numbers and let $S_{i}=S\cap P_{i}$ . It is obvious that $S_{1}\subset S_{2}\subset\cdots\subset S_{n}\subset\ldots.$ This chain is not stationary because $S=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}S_{i}$ . Then, it contains an infinite subchain with distinct sets:  

$$
S_{i_{1}}\subset S_{i_{2}}\subset\cdots\subset S_{i_{n}}\subset\ldots.
$$  

Suppose that $S_{i_{n}}=S_{i_{n+1}}=\cdot\cdot\cdot=S_{i_{n+1}-1}\subset S_{i_{n+1}}$ . Set $i_{1}=k>1$ and choose $p_{1}\in S_{i_{1}}\setminus S_{i_{1}-1}$ , $p_{2}\in S_{i_{2}}\setminus S_{i_{2}-1},...$ , $p_{k}\in S_{i_{k}}\setminus S_{i_{k}-1}$ and $p_{k+1}\in S_{i_{k+1}}\setminus S_{i_{k}}$ . Then $m=p_{1}p_{2}\ldots p_{k}\in A$ and $n=p_{2}p_{3}\ldots p_{k+1}\notin A$ because $p_{2}\notin S_{i_{1}}=S_{k}$ .

( $28^{t h}$ IMO)  

","Solution. It is not difficult to check that the property is verified for $n=2,3$ . So, we may suppose $n\geq5$ and assume the contrary: $k^{2}+k+n$ is prime for $0\leq k\leq{\sqrt{\frac{n}{3}}}$ and there exists $\it{l}$ , ${\sqrt{\frac{n}{3}}}<l\leq n-2$ such that $l^{2}+l+n$ is not prime. Let be the least number $\it{l}$ such that $l^{2}+l+n$ is $p$ composed number and let $p^{2}+p+n=a b$ be a nontrivial decomposition, such that $1<a\le b$ . Then, $l^{2}+l+n$ is a prime for all $l$ , $l<p$ .  

We prove first that $a\geq p+1$ .  

Assuming the contrary, one obtains $0\leq p-a<p$ and  

$$
(p-a)^{2}+(p-a)+n=p^{2}+p+n+a(a-2p-1)=a(b+a-2p-1).
$$  

Since $(p-a)^{2}+(p-a)+n$ is a prime number, it follows that $b{+}a{-}2p{-}1=1$ and then, $a+b=2(p+1)$ . By AM-GM inequality,  

$$
a b\leq{\frac{(a+b)^{2}}{4}}=(p+1)^{2}.
$$  

Since $a b=p^{2}+p+n$ , it follows that: $p^{2}+p+n\leq(p+1)^{2}$ . From the last inequality, $p\ge n-1$ and this contradicts the choice of $p$ . The conclusion is $a\geq p+1$ .  

Since $n<3p^{2}$ , $p^{2}+p+n<4p^{2}+p<(2p+1)^{2}$ . Taking in account that $p^{2}+p+n=a b$ , we have $a b<(2p+1)^{2}$ and thus, $a<2p+1$ .  

We may repeat the previous argument: $0\leq a-p-1<p$ and then $(a-p-1)^{2}+(a-p-1)+n$ is prime a number. A standard computation gives:  

$$
(a-p-1)^{2}+(a-p-1)+n=p^{2}+p+n+a(a-2p-1)=a(b+a-2p-1).
$$  

We obtain, again $b+a=2p+2=2(p+1)$ .  

On the other hand:  

$$
a+b\geq2{\sqrt{a b}}=2{\sqrt{p^{2}+p+n}}>2{\sqrt{p^{2}+p+p+1}}=2(p+1).
$$  

Thus, we obtain a contradiction, so our initial assumption was incorrect.

$$
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)=n!,\quad g c d(x,y)=1998?
$$  

(b) For which $n$ is the number of such pairs $x,y$ with $x\leq y$ less than 1998?  

(1998 Hungarian Mathematical Olympiad)  

Solution. (a) Let $x=1998a$ , $y=1998b$ . So $a,b$ are positive integers such that $a<b$ , $g c d(a,b)=1$ . We have $\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)=1998a b=2\cdot3^{3}\cdot37a b=n!$ . Thus $n\geq37$ and it is easy to see that this condition is also sufficient.  

(b) The answers are $n=37,38,39,40$ . We only need to consider positive integers $n\geq37$ . For $37\leq n<41$ , let $k=a b=n!/1998$ . Since $g c d(a,b)=1$ , any prime factor of $k$ that occurs in $a$ cannot occur in $b$ , and vice-versa. There are 11 prime factors of $k$ , namely 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31. For each of those prime factors, one must decide only whether it occurs in $a$ or in $b$ . These 11 decisions can be made in a total of $2^{11}=2048$ ways. However, only half of these ways will satisfy the condition $a\ <\ b$ . Thus there will be a total of 1024 such pairs of $(x,y)$ for $n=37$ , 38, 39, 40. Since

$$

","Solution. We show that the maximum length is $p-1$ if $k\neq0$ and $p$ + is $k=0$ . In a $p$ -term arithmetic progression, the lowest nonconstant digit takes all values from $0$ to $p-1$ .

From $2k-1=2(k-1)+1$ one obtains that the binary representation of $k-1$ also contains two digits 1. Hence, the last digit of $k-1$ is $^{1}$ and the last but one digit is $0$ .

","Solution. It is well-known that if $g c d(s,t)=1$ , then $s^{k}\equiv1{\pmod{t}}$ ) for some $k$ : indeed, of all the positive powers of $s$ , some two $s^{k_{1}}<s^{k_{2}}$ must be congruent modulo $t$ , and then $s^{k_{2}-k_{1}}\equiv1{\pmod{t}}$ .  

First suppose that $p\neq2,5$ . Then $g c d(p,10^{m+1})=1$ , so there exists such $k$ that $p^{k}\equiv1$ (mod $10^{m+1}$ ). Then $p^{k}=a\cdot10^{m+1}+1$ , so there are $m$ consecutive zeroes in the decimal representation of $p^{k}$ .  

Now suppose that $p=2$ . We claim that for any $a$ , some power of 2 has the following final $a$ digits: $a-\lceil\log2^{a}\rceil$ zeroes, followed by the $\lceil\log2^{a}\rceil$ digits of $2^{a}$ . Because $g c d(2,5^{a})=1$ , there exists $k$ such that $2^{k}\equiv1$ (mod $5^{a}$ ).  

Let $b=k+a$ . Then $2^{b}\equiv2^{a}$ (mod $5^{a}$ ), and $2^{b}\equiv0\equiv2^{a}$ (mod $2^{a}$ ). Hence, $2^{b}\equiv2^{a}$ (mod $10^{a}$ ). Because $2^{a}<10^{a}$ , it follows that $2^{b}$ has the required property.  

Now, simply choose $a$ such that $a-\left\lceil\log2^{a}\right\rceil\geq m$ (for instance, we could choose $a=\left\lceil{\frac{m+1}{1-\log2}}\right\rceil)$ . Then $2^{b}$ contains at least $m$ consecutive zeroes, as desired.  

Finally, the case $p=5$ is done analogously to the case $p=2$ .  

Remark. Actually, the property holds for every integer $p\geq2$ . If $p$ is a power of 2, it is trivial. Otherwise, one can prove using Kronecker $^{1}$ ’s theorem (stating that for $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ the set of $\{n_{\alpha}\}$ with $n\in\mathbb N$ is dense in $\lfloor0,1\rfloor$ ) that the numbers $p^{n}$ can start with any combination of digits we may need, in particular with ${}^{1}\underbrace{00\ldots0}_{\mathrm{~}\mathrm{~}}$ .

First suppose that $p\neq2,5$ . Then $g c d(p,10^{m+1})=1$ , so there exists such $k$ that $p^{k}\equiv1$ (mod $10^{m+1}$ ). Then $p^{k}=a\cdot10^{m+1}+1$ , so there are $m$ consecutive zeroes in the decimal representation of $p^{k}$ .  

Now suppose that $p=2$ . We claim that for any $a$ , some power of 2 has the following final $a$ digits: $a-\lceil\log2^{a}\rceil$ zeroes, followed by the $\lceil\log2^{a}\rceil$ digits of $2^{a}$ . Because $g c d(2,5^{a})=1$ , there exists $k$ such that $2^{k}\equiv1$ (mod $5^{a}$ ).  

Let $b=k+a$ . Then $2^{b}\equiv2^{a}$ (mod $5^{a}$ ), and $2^{b}\equiv0\equiv2^{a}$ (mod $2^{a}$ ). Hence, $2^{b}\equiv2^{a}$ (mod $10^{a}$ ). Because $2^{a}<10^{a}$ , it follows that $2^{b}$ has the required property.  

Now, simply choose $a$ such that $a-\left\lceil\log2^{a}\right\rceil\geq m$ (for instance, we could choose $a=\left\lceil{\frac{m+1}{1-\log2}}\right\rceil)$ . Then $2^{b}$ contains at least $m$ consecutive zeroes, as desired.  

Finally, the case $p=5$ is done analogously to the case $p=2$ .  

Remark. Actually, the property holds for every integer $p\geq2$ . If $p$ is a power of 2, it is trivial. Otherwise, one can prove using Kronecker $^{1}$ ’s theorem (stating that for $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ the set of $\{n_{\alpha}\}$ with $n\in\mathbb N$ is dense in $\lfloor0,1\rfloor$ ) that the numbers $p^{n}$ can start with any combination of digits we may need, in particular with ${}^{1}\underbrace{00\ldots0}_{\mathrm{~}\mathrm{~}}$ .

","Solution. It is not difficult to see that, when divided by 9, the remainder is 5. The ten-digit number containing all digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is a multiple of 9, because the sum of its digits has this property. So, in our nine-digit number, 4 is missing.

( $33^{r d}$ IMO)  

","Solution. (a) Representing $n^{2}$ as a sum of $n^{2}-13$ squares is equivalent to representing 13 as a sum of numbers of the form $x^{2}-1$ , $x\in\mathbb{N}$ , such  

as $\ 0,3,8,15,\ldots$ But it is easy to check that this is impossible, and hence $s(n)\leq n^{2}-14$ .  

(b) Let us prove that $s(13)=13^{2}-14=155$ . Observe that

$$  

Given any representation of $n^{2}$ as a sum of $m$ squares one of which is even, we can construct a representation as a sum of $m+3$ squares by dividing the odd square into four equal squares. Thus the first equality enables us to construct representations with $5,8,11,\ldots,155$ squares, the second to construct ones with $7,10,13,\ldots,154$ squares, and the third with $^{9,12,...,153}$ squares. It remains only to represent $13^{2}$ as a sum of $k=$ $2,3,4,6$ squares. This can be done as follows:  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{13^{2}=12^{2}+5^{2}=12^{2}+4^{2}+3^{2}}\\ &{~=11^{2}+4^{2}+4^{2}+4^{2}}\\ &{~=12^{2}+3^{2}+2^{2}+2^{2}+2^{2}+2^{2}.}\end{array}}
$$  

(c) We shall prove that whenever $s(n)=n^{2}-14$ for some $n\geq13$ , it also holds that $s(2n)=(2n)^{2}-14$ . This will imply that $s(n)=n^{2}-14$ for any $n=2^{t}\cdot13$ .  

If $n^{2}=x_{1}^{2}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+x_{r}^{2}$ , then we have $(2n)^{2}\ =\ (2x_{1})^{2}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+(2x_{r})^{2}$ . Replacing $(2x_{i})^{2}$ with $x_{i}^{2}+x_{i}^{2}+x_{i}^{2}+x_{i}^{2}$ as long as it is possible we can obtain representations of $(2n)^{2}$ consisting of $r,r+3,\ldots,4r$ squares. This gives representations of $(2n)^{2}$ into $k$ squares for any $k\leq4n^{2}-62$ . Further, we observe that each number $m\geq14$ can be written as a sum of $k\geq m$ numbers of the form $x^{2}-1$ , $x\in\mathbb{N}$ , which is easy to verify. Therefore if $k\leq4n^{2}-14$ , it follows that $4n^{2}-k$ is a sum of $k$ numbers of the form $x^{2}-1$ (since $k\geq4n^{2}-k\geq14$ ), and consequently $4n^{2}$ is a sum of $k$ squares.

","Problem. For each positive integer $n$ , denote by $s(n)$ the greatest integer such that for all positive integer $k\leq s(n)$ , $n^{2}$ can be expressed as $a$ sum of squares of $k$ positive integers.

(b) Find a number n such that $s(n)=n^{2}-14$ .   
(c) Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers n such that  

$$
s(n)=n^{2}-14.
$$  

( $33^{r d}$ IMO)  

Solution. (a) Representing $n^{2}$ as a sum of $n^{2}-13$ squares is equivalent to representing 13 as a sum of numbers of the form $x^{2}-1$ , $x\in\mathbb{N}$ , such  

as $\ 0,3,8,15,\ldots$ But it is easy to check that this is impossible, and hence $s(n)\leq n^{2}-14$ .  

(b) Let us prove that $s(13)=13^{2}-14=155$ . Observe that  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{13^{2}=8^{2}+8^{2}+4^{2}+4^{2}+3^{2}}\\ &{\qquad=8^{2}+8^{2}+4^{2}+4^{2}+2^{2}+2^{2}+1^{2}}\\ &{\qquad=8^{2}+8^{2}+4^{2}+3^{2}+3^{2}+2^{2}+1^{2}+1^{2}+1^{2}.}\end{array}}
$$  

Given any representation of $n^{2}$ as a sum of $m$ squares one of which is even, we can construct a representation as a sum of $m+3$ squares by dividing the odd square into four equal squares. Thus the first equality enables us to construct representations with $5,8,11,\ldots,155$ squares, the second to construct ones with $7,10,13,\ldots,154$ squares, and the third with $^{9,12,...,153}$ squares. It remains only to represent $13^{2}$ as a sum of $k=$ $2,3,4,6$ squares. This can be done as follows:  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{13^{2}=12^{2}+5^{2}=12^{2}+4^{2}+3^{2}}\\ &{~=11^{2}+4^{2}+4^{2}+4^{2}}\\ &{~=12^{2}+3^{2}+2^{2}+2^{2}+2^{2}+2^{2}.}\end{array}}
$$  

(c) We shall prove that whenever $s(n)=n^{2}-14$ for some $n\geq13$ , it also holds that $s(2n)=(2n)^{2}-14$ . This will imply that $s(n)=n^{2}-14$ for any $n=2^{t}\cdot13$ .  

If $n^{2}=x_{1}^{2}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+x_{r}^{2}$ , then we have $(2n)^{2}\ =\ (2x_{1})^{2}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+(2x_{r})^{2}$ . Replacing $(2x_{i})^{2}$ with $x_{i}^{2}+x_{i}^{2}+x_{i}^{2}+x_{i}^{2}$ as long as it is possible we can obtain representations of $(2n)^{2}$ consisting of $r,r+3,\ldots,4r$ squares. This gives representations of $(2n)^{2}$ into $k$ squares for any $k\leq4n^{2}-62$ . Further, we observe that each number $m\geq14$ can be written as a sum of $k\geq m$ numbers of the form $x^{2}-1$ , $x\in\mathbb{N}$ , which is easy to verify. Therefore if $k\leq4n^{2}-14$ , it follows that $4n^{2}-k$ is a sum of $k$ numbers of the form $x^{2}-1$ (since $k\geq4n^{2}-k\geq14$ ), and consequently $4n^{2}$ is a sum of $k$ squares.

","Problem. Find all the positive perfect cubes that are not divisible by 10 so that the number obtained by erasing the last three digits is also $a$ perfect cube.  

Solution. We have $(10m+n)^{3}=1000a^{3}+b$ , where $1\leq n\leq9$ and $b<1000$ .

(a) How small can the sum of the digits (in base 10) of such a number be? (b) Can such a number have the sum of its digits (in base 10) equal to 1999?  

(1999 United Kingdom Mathematical Olympiad)  

","Solution. (a) Let $f(n)=3n^{2}+n+1$ . When $n=8$ , the sum of the digits of $f(8)=201$ is 3. Suppose that there was some $m$ such that $f(m)$ had a smaller sum of digits. Then the last digit of $f(m)$ must be either $0$ , $^{1}$ , or 2. Because $f(n)\equiv1$ (mod 2) for all $n$ , $f(m)$ must have units digit 1.  

Because $f(n)$ can never equal 1, this means we must have $3m^{2}+m+1=$ $10^{k}+1$ for some positive integer $k$ , and $m(3m+1)=10^{k}$ . Because $m$ and $3m+1$ are relatively prime, and $m<3m+1$ , we must either have $(m,3m+1)=(1,10^{k})$ – which is impossible – or $(m,3m+1)=(2^{k},5^{k})$ . For $k=1$ , $5^{k}\neq3\cdot2^{k}+1$ ; for $k>1$ , we have  

$$
5^{k}=5^{k-2}\cdot25>2^{k-2}\cdot(12+1)\geq3\cdot2^{k}+1.
$$  

Therefore, $f(m)$ can’t equal $10^{k}+1$ , and 3 is indeed the minimum value for the sum of digits.

$$
f(n)=3\cdot10^{444}-6\cdot10^{222}+3+10^{222}.

(a) How small can the sum of the digits (in base 10) of such a number be? (b) Can such a number have the sum of its digits (in base 10) equal to 1999?  

(1999 United Kingdom Mathematical Olympiad)  

Solution. (a) Let $f(n)=3n^{2}+n+1$ . When $n=8$ , the sum of the digits of $f(8)=201$ is 3. Suppose that there was some $m$ such that $f(m)$ had a smaller sum of digits. Then the last digit of $f(m)$ must be either $0$ , $^{1}$ , or 2. Because $f(n)\equiv1$ (mod 2) for all $n$ , $f(m)$ must have units digit 1.  

Because $f(n)$ can never equal 1, this means we must have $3m^{2}+m+1=$ $10^{k}+1$ for some positive integer $k$ , and $m(3m+1)=10^{k}$ . Because $m$ and $3m+1$ are relatively prime, and $m<3m+1$ , we must either have $(m,3m+1)=(1,10^{k})$ – which is impossible – or $(m,3m+1)=(2^{k},5^{k})$ . For $k=1$ , $5^{k}\neq3\cdot2^{k}+1$ ; for $k>1$ , we have  

$$
5^{k}=5^{k-2}\cdot25>2^{k-2}\cdot(12+1)\geq3\cdot2^{k}+1.
$$  

Therefore, $f(m)$ can’t equal $10^{k}+1$ , and 3 is indeed the minimum value for the sum of digits.  

(b) Consider $n=10^{222}-1$ .  

$$
f(n)=3\cdot10^{444}-6\cdot10^{222}+3+10^{222}.
$$  

Thus, its decimal expansion is  

$$

(b) We will need the following lemmas.  

Lemma 1. For every $d>0$ there exists a $d$ -digit number that contains only ones and twos in its decimal expansion and is a multiple of $2^{d}$ .  

Proof. Exactly in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 1.7.1 one can prove that any two $d$ -digit numbers which have only ones and twos give different residues mod $2^{d}$ . Since there are $2^{d}$ such numbers, one of them is a multiple of $2^{d}$ . □  

Lemma 2. For each $k>2$ there exists $d\leq k$ such that the following inequality holds: $k+d\leq2^{d}\leq9k-8d$ .  

Proof. For $3\le k\le5$ , $d=3$ satisfies the inequalities. For $5\leq k\leq10$ , $d=4$ satisfies the inequalities. We will show that $d=\lfloor\log_{2}4k\rfloor$ satisfies for all $k>10$ . If $k>3$ , then $\log_{2}{4k}\leq2^{k}$ , so $d<k$ . Additionally, $k+d\leq2k\leq$ $2^{d}$ . If $k>10$ , then $16k^{2}\leq2^{k}$ , so $4k\leq2^{k/2}\leq2^{5k/8}$ , $d\leq\log_{2}{4k}\leq\frac{5}{8}n$ n and $8k-8d\geq4k\geq2^{d}$ . $\sqsubset$  

Now, return to the original problem. For $k=1$ , $n=1$ has the desired property. For $k=2$ , $n=12$ has the desired property. Now, for each $k>2$ we have some number $d$ satisfying the condition Lemma 2. Consider a $k$ -digit integer $n$ such that the last $d$ digits of $n$ have the property described in the first Lemma. We can choose each of the other digits of $n$ to be any number between zero and nine. We know that the sum of the last $d$ digits of $n$ is between $d$ and $2d$ , and we can choose the sum of the other $k-d$ digits to be any number between $k-d$ and $9(k-d)$ . Since $k-d+2d\leq2^{d}\leq9(k-d)+d$ , we can choose the other digits such that the sum of the digits of $n$ is $2^{d}$ . This completes the proof because $n$ is a multiple of $2^{d}$ .

( $35^{t h}$ IMO Shortlist)  

","Solution. If $n$ is a multiple of 10, then the last digit of any multiple of $n$ is $0$ . Hence it is not wobbly. If $n$ is a multiple of 25, then the last two digits of any multiple of $n$ are 25, 50, 75 or 00. Hence it is not wobbly. We now prove that these are the only numbers not dividing any wobbly number.  

We first consider odd numbers $m$ not divisible by 5. Then $g c d(m,10)=1$ , and we have $g c d((10^{k}-1)m,10)=1$ , for any $k\geq1$ . It follows that there exists a positive integer $\it l$ such that $10^{l}\equiv1$ (mod $(10^{k}-1)m,$ ), and we have $10^{k l}\equiv1$ (mod $(10^{k}-1)m)$ . Now  

$$
10^{k l}-1=(10^{k}-1)(10^{k(l-1)}+10^{k(l-2)}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+10^{k}-1).
$$  

Hence $x_{k}=10^{k(l-1)}+10^{k(l-2)}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+10^{k}+1$ is a multiple of $m$ for any $k\geq1$ . In particular, $x_{2}$ is a wobbly multiple of $m$ . If $m$ is divisible by 5, then $5x_{2}$ is a wobbly multiple of $m$ .  

Next, we consider powers of 2. We prove by induction on $t$ that $2^{2t+1}$ has a wobbly multiple $w_{t}$ with precisely $t$ non-zero digits. For $t=1$ , take $w_{1}=8$ . Suppose $w_{t}$ exists for some $t\geq1$ . Then $w_{t}=2^{2t+1}d$ for some $d$ . Let $w_{t+1}=$ $10^{2t}c+w_{t}$ where $c\in\{1,2,3,...,9\}$ is to be chosen later. Clearly, $w_{t+1}$ is wobbly, and has precisely $t+1$ non-zero digits. Since $w_{t+1}+2^{2t}(5^{2t}c+2d)$ , it is divisible by $2^{2t+3}$ if and only if $5^{2t}c+2d\equiv0$ (mod 8) or $c\equiv6d$ (mod 8). We can always choose $c$ to be one of 8, $6$ , 4 and 2 in order to satisfy this congruence. Thus the inductive argument is completed. It now follows that every power of 2 has a wobbly multiple.  

Finally, consider numbers of the form $2^{t}m$ , where $t\geq1$ and $g c d(m,10)=$ 1. Such a number has $w_{t}x_{2t}$ as a wobbly multiple.

$$
10^{k l}-1=(10^{k}-1)(10^{k(l-1)}+10^{k(l-2)}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+10^{k}-1).
$$  

Hence $x_{k}=10^{k(l-1)}+10^{k(l-2)}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+10^{k}+1$ is a multiple of $m$ for any $k\geq1$ . In particular, $x_{2}$ is a wobbly multiple of $m$ . If $m$ is divisible by 5, then $5x_{2}$ is a wobbly multiple of $m$ .

","Solution. More generally, we prove by induction on $n$ that for any real number $0\textless r\textless1$ , there exists $0<\varepsilon<r$ such that for $a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}$ any positive real numbers, there exists $t>0$ with

Assume without loss of generality that $a_{n}$ is the largest of the $a_{i}$ . By hypothesis, for any $r^{\prime}>0$ (which we will specify later) there exists $\varepsilon^{\prime}>0$ such that for any $a_{1},\dotsc,a_{n-1}>0$ , there exists $t^{\prime}>0$ such that

Let $s t^{\prime}a_{n}$ be one such term, and take $t=$ $s t^{\prime}+c$ for $c=(r-1/N)/a_{n}$ . Then

So we choose $N$ such that $0<r-2/N$ , thus making $\{t a_{n}\}\in(r-2/N,r)$ . Note that this choice of $N$ makes $c>0$ and $t>0$ , as well.  

As for the other $t a_{i}$ , for each $i$ we have $k_{i}+\varepsilon^{\prime}<t^{\prime}a_{i}<k_{i}+r^{\prime}$ for some integer $k_{i}$ , so $s k_{i}+s\varepsilon^{\prime}<s t^{\prime}a_{i}<s k_{i}+s r^{\prime}$ and

Second, we claim that $x_{1},y_{1},z_{1}>0$ . This is obvious for $x_{1}$ . Next, note that $y_{1}=x_{0}+y_{0}-2z_{0}\geq2{\sqrt{x_{0}y_{0}}}-2z_{0}>2z_{0}-2z_{0}=0$ . Finally, because $x_{0}\leq y_{0}$ and $x_{0}y_{0}=z_{0}^{2}+1$ , we have $x_{0}\leq\sqrt{z_{0}^{2}+1}$ , or $x_{0}\le z_{0}$ . However, $x_{0}\neq z_{0}$ , because this would imply that $z_{0}y_{0}=z_{0}^{2}+1$ , but $z_{0}\uparrow(z_{0}^{2}+1)$ when $z_{0}>1$ . Thus, $z_{0}-x_{0}>0$ , or $z_{1}>0$ .  

Therefore, $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ is a triple of positive integers $(x,y,z)$ satisfying $x y=z^{2}+1$ and with $z<z_{0}$ . By the induction hypothesis, we can write $x_{1}=a^{2}+b^{2}$ , $y_{1}=c^{2}+d^{2}$ and $z_{1}=a c+b d$ . Then

\begin{array}{r l}&{(a c+b d)^{2}=z_{1}^{2}=x_{1}y_{1}-1}\\ &{\qquad=(a^{2}+b^{2})(c^{2}+d^{2})-1}\\ &{\qquad=(a^{2}c^{2}+b^{2}d^{2}+2a b c d)+(a^{2}d^{2}+b^{2}c^{2}-2a b c d)-1}\\ &{\qquad=(a c+b d)^{2}(a d-b c)^{2}-1,}\end{array}
$$  

so that $|a d-b c|=1$ .  

Now, note that $x_{0}=x_{1}=a^{2}+b^{2}$ and $y_{0}=x_{1}+y_{1}+2z_{1}=a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+$ $2(a c+b d)=(a+c)^{2}+(b+d)^{2}$ . In other words, $x_{0}={a^{\prime}}^{2}+{b^{\prime}}^{2}$ and $y_{0}={c^{\prime}}^{2}+{d^{\prime}}^{2}$ for $(a^{\prime},b^{\prime},c^{\prime},d^{\prime})=(a,b,a+c,b+d)$ . Then $|a^{\prime}d^{\prime}-b^{\prime}c^{\prime}|=|a d-b c|=1$ , implying (by logic analogous to the reasoning in the previous paragraph) that $z_{0}=a^{\prime}c^{\prime}+b^{\prime}d^{\prime}$ , as desired. This completes the inductive step, and the proof.

completing the inductive step. Thus, $P(n)\leq n+1$ for all $n$ .  

If $P(n)=n$ , then $n$ has more than one digit and we may write $n=10s{+}t$ . From the first statement, we have $P(s)\geq s+1$ . From the second one, we have $P(s)\leq s+1$ . Thus, $P(s)=s+1$ . Hence,

","Solution. It is possible. We begin by proving the following lemma:  

Lemma. Given a set $S$ of positive integers, there is a subset $T\subseteq S$ such that every element of $S$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ .  

Proof. We prove the claim by induction on $|S|$ , the number of elements in $S$ . If $|S|=1$ then let $T=S$ .  

If $|S|>1$ , then let $\alpha$ be the smallest element of $S$ . Consider the set $S^{\prime}=S\backslash\{a\}$ , the set of the largest $|S|-1$ elements in $S$ . By induction there is a subset $T^{\prime}\subseteq S^{\prime}$ such that every element in $S^{\prime}$ divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\prime}$ .  

If $a$ also divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\prime}$ , then the set $T=T^{\prime}$ suffices. Otherwise, consider the set ${\cal T}={\cal T}^{\prime}\cup\{a\}$ . $a$ divides an odd number of elements in $T$ . Every other element in $T$ is bigger than $a$ and can’t divide it, but divides an odd number of elements in $T^{\prime}=T\backslash\{a\}$ . Hence $T$ suffices, completing the induction and the proof of the lemma. □  

Now, write each number $n>1$ in its prime factorization  

$$
n=p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\cdot\cdot\cdot p_{k}^{a_{k}},
$$  

where the $p_{i}$ are distinct primes and the $a_{i}$ ate positive integers. Notice that the color of $n$ will always be the same as the color of $P(n)=p_{1}p_{2}\ldots p_{k}$ .  

Apply the lemma to the set $S$ consisting in all $P(i)$ for $\begin{array}{r l}{i}&{{}=}\end{array}$ $2,3,\ldots,1000000$ to find a subset $T\subset S$ such that every element of $S$  

divides an odd number of elements in $T$ . For each $q\in S$ , let $t(q)$ equal the   
number of elements in $T$ that divides, and let $u(q)$ equal the number of $q$   
primes dividing $q$ .  

Select all the numbers in $T$ , and consider how the color of a number $n>1$ changes. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of elements in $T$ not relatively prime to $n$ equals  

$$
\sum_{q|P(n),q>1}(-1)^{u(q)+1}t(q).
$$  

In particular, if $q|P(n)$ is divisible by exactly $m>0$ primes, then it is counted ${\binom{m}{1}}-{\binom{m}{2}}+{\binom{m}{3}}-\cdots=1$ time in the sum. (For example, if $n\ =\ 6$ then the number of elements in $T$ divisible by 2 or 3 equals $t(2)+t(3)-t(6)$ .)  

By the definition of $T$ , each of the values $t(q)$ is odd. Because there are $2^{k}-1$ divisors $q>1$ of $P(n)$ , the above quantity is the sum of $2^{k}-1$ odd numbers and is odd itself. Therefore after selecting $T$ , every number $n>1$ will switch color an odd number of times and will turn white.  

Finally, select 1 to turn 1 white to complete the process.  

Note. In fact, a slight modification of the above proof shows that $T$ is unique. With some work, this stronger result implies that there is in essence exactly one way to make all the numbers white up to trivial manipulations.  

Second solution. Yes, it is possible. We prove a more general statement, where we replace 1000000 in the problem by some arbitrary positive integer $m$ . We also focus on the numbers divisible by just a few primes instead of all the primes.  

Lemma. For a finite set of distinct primes $S~=~\{p1,p_{2},...,p_{n}\}$ , let $Q_{m}(S)$ be the set of numbers between $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Z}}$ and $m$ divisible only by primes in $S$ . The elements of $Q_{m}(S)$ can be colored black or white. A permissible move consists of selecting a number in $Q_{m}(S)$ and changing the color of that number and each number not relatively prime to it. Then it is possible to reverse the coloring of $Q_{m}(S)$ by selecting several numbers in a subset $R_{m}(S)\subseteq Q_{m}(S)$ .  

Proof. We prove the lemma by induction on $n$ . If $n=1$ , then selecting $p_{1}$ suffices. Now suppose $n>1$ , and assume without loss of generality that the numbers are all black to start with.  

Let $T=\{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n-1}\}$ , and define $t$ to be the largest integer such that $t p_{n}\leq m$ . We can assume $t\geq1$ because otherwise we could ignore $p_{n}$ and just use the smaller set $T$ , and we’d be done by our induction hypothesis.  

Now select the numbers in $R_{m}(T),R_{t}(T)$ , and $p_{n}R_{t}(T)\ =\ \{p_{n}x|\ x\ \in$ $R_{t}(T)\}$ , and consider the effect of this action on a number $y$ :  

$y$ is not a multiple of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. If selecting $x\in R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color, selecting $x p_{n}$ will change it back so that $y$ will become white.   
$y$ is a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ and $R_{t}(T)$ has no effect on $y$ , but each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.   
$p_{n}|y$ but $y$ is not a power of $p_{n}$ . Selecting the numbers in $R_{m}(T)$ makes $y$ white. Because $y\neq p_{n}^{i}$ , it is divisible by some prime in $T$ so selecting the numbers in $R_{t}(T)$ makes $y$ black again. Finally, each of the $|R_{t}(T)|$ numbers in $x R_{t}(T)$ changes $y$ ’s color.  

Therefore, all the multiples of $p_{n}$ are the same color (black if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is even, white if $|R_{t}(T)|$ is odd), while all the other numbers in $Q_{m}(S)$ are white. If the multiples of $p_{n}$ are still black, we can select $p_{n}$ to make them white, and we are done. $\boxed{\begin{array}{r l}\end{array}}$  

We now return to the original problem. Set $m=1000000$ , and let $S$ be the set of all primes under 1000000. From the lemma, we can select numbers between 2 and 1000000 so that all the numbers $2,3,\ldots,1000000$ are white. Finally, complete the process by selecting 1.

","Solution. 1) Let $f$ be multiplicative. If the constellations for $a$ and $b$ have no prime in common, then the same is true of their factorizations, so $f(a b)=f(a)f(b)$ . Hence $f$ is generally multiplicative.

2) Let $h$ be an additive function (i.e. $h(a b)=h(a)+h(b)$ whenever $g c d(a,b)=1$ ). Call a function $k$ generally additive if $k(a b)=k(a)+k(b)$ whenever the constellations for a and $b$ have no prime in common. Prove that every additive function is generally additive. Is the converse true?  

(American Mathematical Monthly)  

Solution. 1) Let $f$ be multiplicative. If the constellations for $a$ and $b$ have no prime in common, then the same is true of their factorizations, so $f(a b)=f(a)f(b)$ . Hence $f$ is generally multiplicative.  

The converse is not true. Indeed, define $g(a)$ to the product of all primes in the constellation of $a$ , taken once only, regardless of how many times they appear in the constellation. Then $g$ is clearly generally multiplicative, but $g(9)=6$ , $g(2)=2$ and $g(18)=6$ , so $g(9\cdot2)\neq g(9)g(2)$ .  

2) The statement ”additive implies generally additive” can be proved in the same way. If $k(a)$ is the sum of all primes in the constellation of $a$ each taken once only, then $k$ is generally additive but $k(9)=5$ , $k(2)=2$ and $k(18)=5$ .

542,(Arithmetic Functions)->(Number of divisors),"Problem. Does there exist a positive integer such that the product of its proper divisors ends with exactly 2001 zeroes?  

# (2001 Russian Mathematical Olympiad)  

","Solution. Yes. Given an integer $n$ with $\tau(n)$ is equal to  

$$
\sqrt{\left(\prod_{d\mid n}d\right)\left(\prod_{d\mid n}(n/d)\right)}=\sqrt{\prod_{d\mid n}d(n/d)}=\sqrt{n^{\tau(n)}}.
$$  

Thus, the product of all proper positive divisors of $n$ equals  

$$
n^{{\frac{1}{2}}\tau(n)-1}.
$$  

If $n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}^{q_{i}}$ with the $p_{i}$ ’s distinct primes and the $q_{i}$ ’s positive integers, then $\tau(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}(q_{i}+1)$ . Hence, if we set $n=2^{1}\cdot5^{1}\cdot7^{6}\cdot11^{10}\cdot13^{12}$ , then  

$$
{\frac{1}{2}}\tau(n)-1={\frac{1}{2}}(2\cdot2\cdot7\cdot11\cdot13)-1=2001.
$$  

Thus, the product of the proper divisors of $n$ is equal to $2^{2001}\cdot5^{2001}$ 76·2001 · 1110·2001 · 1312·2001, an integer ending in exactly 2001 zeroes.

Solution. Yes. Given an integer $n$ with $\tau(n)$ is equal to  

$$
\sqrt{\left(\prod_{d\mid n}d\right)\left(\prod_{d\mid n}(n/d)\right)}=\sqrt{\prod_{d\mid n}d(n/d)}=\sqrt{n^{\tau(n)}}.
$$  

Thus, the product of all proper positive divisors of $n$ equals  

$$
n^{{\frac{1}{2}}\tau(n)-1}.
$$  

If $n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}^{q_{i}}$ with the $p_{i}$ ’s distinct primes and the $q_{i}$ ’s positive integers, then $\tau(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}(q_{i}+1)$ . Hence, if we set $n=2^{1}\cdot5^{1}\cdot7^{6}\cdot11^{10}\cdot13^{12}$ , then  

$$

Thus, the product of the proper divisors of $n$ is equal to $2^{2001}\cdot5^{2001}$ 76·2001 · 1110·2001 · 1312·2001, an integer ending in exactly 2001 zeroes.

$$  

It follows directly from this definition that $f(n)$ is multiplicative. Now we apply (1). The even divisors of $n$ do not influence its left-hand side. Each divisor of the form $4k+1$ contributes a 1, and each divisor of the form $4k+3$ contributes $a-1$ . Consequently, it suffices to prove that the summation function of $f,\sum_{d\mid n}f(d)$ is nonnegative for each positive integer $n$ .  

Take any prime divisor $p_{i}$ of $n$ . If $p_{i}\equiv1$ (mod 4), then the same congruence holds for all powers of $p_{i}$ , so the $\textit{\textbf{\i}}$ th factor in the right-hand side of (1) is positive. If $p_{i}$ is congruent to 3 modulo 4, then so are its odd powers while the even powers are congruent to 1 modulo 4. In this case the $i$ th factor in the right-hand side has the form $1-1+1-1+...$ , and it equals $^{1}$ or 0 according as $\alpha_{i}$ is even or odd.

","Solution. It is given that the reduced system of residues modn chosen from the set $\{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$ is an arithmetic progression. We write it as an increasing sequence $1=a_{1}<a_{2}<\cdots<a_{k}=n-1$ .  

For a prime number $n$ the reduced system of residues is the sequence $1<2<\cdots<n-1$ and it is an arithmetic progression with ratio 1. If $n=2^{l}$ the reduced system of residues is $1<3<5<\cdots<2^{l}-1$ and it is an arithmetic progression with ratio 2. The problem asks to prove that only these cases can appear.  

Let $a_{2}$ be the second member of the progression. Because $a_{2}>1$ is the least positive number relatively prime to $n$ , it is a prime number, say $p$ and $p>3$ . Then, the ratio of the progression is $a_{2}\:-\:a_{1}=p\:-\:1$ and $a_{k}=n-1=1+(k-1)(p-1)$ . We obtain a ”key” formula:  

$$
n-2=(k-1)(p-1).
$$  

Remembering the choice of $p$ , $n$ is divisible by 3 and then $n-2\equiv1$ (mod 3). Thus, by the key formula we cannot have $p\equiv1$ (mod 3). Since $p>3$ we have $p\equiv2$ (mod 3). Then $a_{3}=1+2(p-1)\equiv0$ (mod 3) and this contradicts the supposition that $a_{3}$ and $n$ are relatively prime numbers.

Lemma. For any real numbers $a,b$  

$$

Proof. Let $a=\lfloor a\rfloor+x$ , $b=\lfloor b\rfloor+y$ where $0\leq x,y<1$ . If $x+y<1$ we have $\lfloor a+b\rfloor=\lfloor a\rfloor+\lfloor b\rfloor$ and the required inequality becomes:

(American Mathematical Monthly)  

Solution. First, let us clearify something. When we write  

$$
\left\lfloor{\frac{n}{p}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor{\frac{n}{p^{2}}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor{\frac{n}{p^{3}}}\right\rfloor+\ldots,
$$  

we write in fact $\sum_{k\geq1}\left\lfloor{\frac{n}{p^{k}}}\right\rfloor$ and this sum has clearly a finite number of nonzero terms. Now, let us take a prime $p$ and let us apply Legendre’s formula formula as well as the first observations. We find that  

$$
v_{p}((3a+3b)!(2a)!(3b)!(2b)!)=\sum_{k\geq1}\left(\left\lfloor{\frac{3a+3b}{p^{k}}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor{\frac{2a}{p^{k}}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor{\frac{3b}{p^{k}}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor{\frac{2b}{p^{k}}}\right\rfloor\right)
$$  

and also  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\displaystyle v_{p}((2a+3b)!(a+2b)!(a+b)!a!(b!)^{2})}}\\ {{=\displaystyle\sum_{k\geq1}\left(\left\lfloor\frac{2a+3b}{p^{k}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{a+2b}{p^{k}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{a+b}{p^{k}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{a}{p^{k}}\right\rfloor+2\left\lfloor\frac{b}{p^{k}}\right\rfloor\right)}}\end{array}
$$  

Of course, it is enough to prove that for each $k\geq1$ the term corresponding to $k$ in the first sum is greater than or equal to the term corresponding to $k$ in the second sum. With the substitution $x={\frac{a}{p^{k}}},y={\frac{b}{p^{k}}}$ k , we have to prove that for any nonnegative real numbers $x,y$ we have  

$$
+\lfloor2y\rfloor\geq\lfloor2x+3y\rfloor+\lfloor x+2y\rfloor+\lfloor x+y\rfloor+\lfloor x\rfloor+2{\left\lfloor y\right.}
$$  

This isn’t easy, but with another useful idea the inequality will become easy. The idea is that  

$$
\left\lfloor3x+3y\right\rfloor=3\lfloor x\rfloor+3\lfloor y\rfloor+\lfloor3\{x\}+3\{y\}\rfloor
$$  

and similar relations for the other terms of the inequality. After this operation, we see that it suffices to prove the inequality only for $0\leq x,y<1$ . Because we can easily compute all terms, after splitting in some cases, so that to see when $\left\lfloor2\{x\}\right\rfloor,\left\lfloor3\{y\}\right\rfloor,\left\lfloor2\{y\}\right\rfloor$ are $0$ , 1 or 2.

(Paul Erdo¨s)  

","Solution. This time the second formula for $e_{p}(n)$ is useful. Of course, there is no reasonable estimation of this constant, so we should better see what happens if $a!\cdot b!|n!$ . Then $e_{2}(a)+e_{2}(b)\leq e_{2}(n!)$ , which can be translated as $a-S_{2}(a)+b-S_{2}(b)\leq n-S_{2}(n)<n$ . So, we have found almost exactly what we needed: $a+b<n+S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ .

555,(More on Divisibility)->(Fermat’s Little Theorem),"Problem. Let $3^{n}-2^{n}$ be a power of a prime for some positive integer n. Prove that $n$ is a prime.  

","Solution. Let $3^{n}-2^{n}=p^{\alpha}$ for some prime $p$ and some $\alpha\geq1$ , and let $q$ be a prime divisor of $n$ . Assume that $q\neq n$ ; then $n=k q$ , where $k>1$ . Since $p^{\alpha}=3^{k q}-2^{k q}=(3^{k})^{q}-(2^{k})^{q}$ , we observe that $p^{\alpha}$ is divisible by $3^{k}-2^{k}$ . Hence $3^{k}-2^{k}=p^{\beta}$ for some $\beta\geq1$ . Now we have  

$$
p^{\alpha}=(2^{k}+p^{\beta})^{q}-2^{k q}

$$
=q2^{k(q-1)}p^{\beta}+\frac{q(q-1)}{2}2^{k(q-2)}p^{2\beta}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+p^{q\beta}.
$$  

Since $\alpha>\beta$ (because $p^{\beta}=3^{k}-2^{k}$ is less than $p^{\alpha}\ =\ 3^{k q}\-\ 2^{k q}$ ), it follows that $p^{\alpha}$ is divisible by a power of $p$ at least as great as $p^{\beta+1}$ . Then the above equality implies that $p$ divides $q2^{k(q-1)}$ . On the other hand, $p$ is obviously odd and hence it divides $q$ . Being a prime, $q$ must be then equal to $p$ . Therefore $n=k q=k p$ and $p^{\alpha}=(3^{p})^{k}-(2^{p})^{k}$ is divisible by $3^{p}-3^{p}$ , implying $3^{p}-2^{p}=p^{\gamma}$ for some $\gamma\geq1$ . In particular, we infer that $3^{p}\equiv2^{p}$ (mod $p$ ). Now, observing that $p\neq2,3$ , we reach a contradiction with Fermat’s Little Theorem, by which  

$$
3^{p}\equiv3{\pmod{p}},2^{p}\equiv2{\pmod{p}}.

$$
=q2^{k(q-1)}p^{\beta}+\frac{q(q-1)}{2}2^{k(q-2)}p^{2\beta}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+p^{q\beta}.
$$  

Since $\alpha>\beta$ (because $p^{\beta}=3^{k}-2^{k}$ is less than $p^{\alpha}\ =\ 3^{k q}\-\ 2^{k q}$ ), it follows that $p^{\alpha}$ is divisible by a power of $p$ at least as great as $p^{\beta+1}$ . Then the above equality implies that $p$ divides $q2^{k(q-1)}$ . On the other hand, $p$ is obviously odd and hence it divides $q$ . Being a prime, $q$ must be then equal to $p$ . Therefore $n=k q=k p$ and $p^{\alpha}=(3^{p})^{k}-(2^{p})^{k}$ is divisible by $3^{p}-3^{p}$ , implying $3^{p}-2^{p}=p^{\gamma}$ for some $\gamma\geq1$ . In particular, we infer that $3^{p}\equiv2^{p}$ (mod $p$ ). Now, observing that $p\neq2,3$ , we reach a contradiction with Fermat’s Little Theorem, by which

3^{p}\equiv3{\pmod{p}},2^{p}\equiv2{\pmod{p}}.

","Solution. (All congruences in this problem are modulo 13.) We claim that  

$$

The case $k=0$ is obvious, so suppose $k>0$ . Let $g$ be a primitive root modulo 13; then the numbers $g,2g,\ldots,12g$ are $1,2,\ldots,12$ in some order, so  

$$
\sum_{x=0}^{12}x^{k}\equiv\sum_{x=0}^{12}(g x)^{k}=g^{k}\sum_{x=0}^{12}x^{k};
$$  

since $g^{k}\not\equiv1$ , we must have $\sum_{x=0}^{12}x^{k}\equiv0$ . This proves our claim.  

Now let $S=\{(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})|0\leq x_{i}\leq12\}$ . It suffices to show that the number of $n$ -tuples $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\in S$ with $f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\neq0$ is divisible by 13, since $|S|=13^{n}$ is divisible by 13. Consider the sum  

$$
\sum_{(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\in S}(f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}))^{12}.
$$  

This sum counts the number of $n$ -tuples $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\ \in\ S$ such that $f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\neq0$ , since by Fermat’s Little Theorem  

$$
(f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}))^{12}\equiv{\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{1,}&{{\mathrm{if}}\quad f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\not\equiv0}\\ {0,}&{{\mathrm{if}}\quad f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\equiv0.}\end{array}\right.}
$$  

On the other hand, we can expand $(f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}))^{12}$ in the form  

$$
(f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}))^{12}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_{j}\prod_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{e_{j i}}
$$  

for some integers $N,c_{j},e_{j i}$ . Since $f$ is a polynomial of total degree less than $n$ , we have $e_{j1}+e_{j2}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+e_{j n}<12n$ for every $j$ , so for each $j$ there exists an $i$ such that $e_{j i}<12$ . Thus by our claim  

$$
\sum_{(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\in S}c_{j}\prod_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{e_{j i}}=c_{j}\prod_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{x=0}^{12}x_{i}^{e_{j i}}\equiv0

since one of the sums in the product is 0. Therefore

so the number of $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})$ such that $f(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\neq0$ (mod 13) divisible by 13 and we are done.

The case $k=0$ is obvious, so suppose $k>0$ . Let $g$ be a primitive root modulo 13; then the numbers $g,2g,\ldots,12g$ are $1,2,\ldots,12$ in some order, so  

$$

for some integers $N,c_{j},e_{j i}$ . Since $f$ is a polynomial of total degree less than $n$ , we have $e_{j1}+e_{j2}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+e_{j n}<12n$ for every $j$ , so for each $j$ there exists an $i$ such that $e_{j i}<12$ . Thus by our claim  

$$

since one of the sums in the product is 0. Therefore

( $44^{t h}$ IMO)  

","Solution. Suppose that for every prime $q$ , there exists an $n$ for which $n^{p}\equiv p$ (mod $q$ ). Assume that $q=k p+1$ . By Fermat’s Little Theorem we deduce that $p^{k}\equiv n^{k p}=n^{q-1}\equiv1$ (mod $q$ ), so $q|p^{k}-1$ .  

It is known that any prime $q$ such that $q|\frac{p^{p}-1}{p-1}$ must satisfy $q\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). Indeed, from $q|p^{q-1}-1$ it follows that $q|p^{g c d(p,q-1)}-1$ ; but $q\nmid p-1$ becaus e p −1 ≡ 1 (mod p − 1), so gcd(p, q − 1) ̸= 1. Hence gcd(p, q − 1) = p. Now suppose q is any prime divisor of p − 1 . Then $q|g c d(p^{k}-1,p^{p}-1)=$ $p^{g c d(p,k)}-1$ , which implies that $g c d(p,k)>1$ , so $p|k$ . Consequently $q\equiv1$ (mod p2). However, the number p − ${\frac{p^{p}-1}{p-1}}=p^{p-1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+p+1$ must have at least one prime divisor that is not congruent to 1 modulo $p^{2}$ . Thus we arrived at a contradiction.  

Remark. Taking $q\equiv1{\pmod{p}}$ is natural, because for every other $q,n^{p}$ takes all possible residues modulo $p$ (including $p$ too).

","Problem. Let $p$ be a prime number. Prove that there exists a prime number $q$ such that for every integer $n$ , the number $n^{p}-p$ is not divisible by $q$ .  

( $44^{t h}$ IMO)  

Solution. Suppose that for every prime $q$ , there exists an $n$ for which $n^{p}\equiv p$ (mod $q$ ). Assume that $q=k p+1$ . By Fermat’s Little Theorem we deduce that $p^{k}\equiv n^{k p}=n^{q-1}\equiv1$ (mod $q$ ), so $q|p^{k}-1$ .  

It is known that any prime $q$ such that $q|\frac{p^{p}-1}{p-1}$ must satisfy $q\equiv1$ (mod $p$ ). Indeed, from $q|p^{q-1}-1$ it follows that $q|p^{g c d(p,q-1)}-1$ ; but $q\nmid p-1$ becaus e p −1 ≡ 1 (mod p − 1), so gcd(p, q − 1) ̸= 1. Hence gcd(p, q − 1) = p. Now suppose q is any prime divisor of p − 1 . Then $q|g c d(p^{k}-1,p^{p}-1)=$ $p^{g c d(p,k)}-1$ , which implies that $g c d(p,k)>1$ , so $p|k$ . Consequently $q\equiv1$ (mod p2). However, the number p − ${\frac{p^{p}-1}{p-1}}=p^{p-1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+p+1$ must have at least one prime divisor that is not congruent to 1 modulo $p^{2}$ . Thus we arrived at a contradiction.  

Remark. Taking $q\equiv1{\pmod{p}}$ is natural, because for every other $q,n^{p}$ takes all possible residues modulo $p$ (including $p$ too). Indeed, if $p\nmid q-1$ , then there is an $r\in\mathbb N$ satisfying $p r\equiv1$ (mod $q-1\rfloor$ ); hence for any $a$ the congruence $n^{p}\equiv a$ (mod $q$ ) has the solution $n\equiv a^{r}~(\mathrm{mod}~q)$ .

","Solution. Although very short, the proof is tricky. Let $n=\prod_{i=1}^{s}p_{i}^{k_{i}}$ where $p_{1}<\dots<p_{s}$ are prime numbers. The idea is to look at $v_{2}(p_{i}-1)$ . Choose that $p_{i}$ which minimizes this quantity and write $p_{i}=1+2^{r_{i}}m_{i}$ with $m_{i}$ odd. Then of course we have $n\equiv1$ (mod $2^{m_{i}}$ ). Hence we can write $n-1=$ $2^{m}t$ . We have $2^{2^{m}t}\equiv-1$ (mod $p_{i}$ ) thus we surely have $-1\equiv2^{2^{m}t m_{i}}\equiv$ $2^{(p_{i}-1)t}\equiv1$ (mod $p_{i}$ ) (the last congruence being derived from Fermat’s theorem).

$\begin{array}{r}{(a,b,c)\in\{(25,7,24),(25,24,7),(17,8,15),(17,15,8),(15,9,12),(15,12,9)\}.}\end{array}$

( $24^{t h}$ IMO)  

","Solution. We will solve the problem in two steps.  

First step. The number $2a b c-a b-b c-c a$ cannot be expressed in the required form. Assume contrary, that:  

$$
2a b c-a b-b c-c a=x b c+y c a+z a b,
$$  

where $x,y,z\geq0$ . Then, one obtains the combination  

$$
2a b c=b c(x+1)+c a(y+1)+a b(z+1)
$$  

where $x+1>0$ , $y+1>0$ , $z+1>0$ . It leads to the divisibility $a|b c(x+1)$  

Since $a$ is relatively prime to $b$ and $c,a$ divides $x+1$ and then $a\leq x+1$ . Using similar arguments, $b\leq y+1$ and $c\leq z+1$ . Thus, $2a b c=b c(x+1)+$ $c a(y+1)+a b(z+1)\geq3a b c$ . This is a contradiction.  

Second step. Any number $N$ , $N>2a b c-a b-b c-c a$ , can be expressed in the form $N=x b c+y c a+z a b$ .  

First, observe that $2a b c-a b-b c-c a+1>0$ . It follows by the following argument:  

$$
\frac{1}{a b c}(2a b c-a b-b c-c a+1)=2-\frac{1}{a}-\frac{1}{b}-\frac{1}{c}+\frac{1}{a b c}>2-\frac{1}{1}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{a b c}>0.
$$  

Going further, we have two situations. When $N\equiv0$ (mod abc), since $N=a b c q$ , we may consider the combination $N=(a b)c q+b c\cdot0+c a\cdot0$ . It is of required form, under notations $x=y=0$ and $z=c q$ .  

Suppose that $N\not\equiv0$ (mod $a b c$ ). Because $g c d(b c,a)=1$ , the congruence  

$$
x b c\equiv N{\pmod{a}}
$$  

has a solution $x_{0}$ , $0<x_{0}<a$ . Similarly, the congruences  

$$
\begin{array}{c c}{{y c a\equiv N}}&{{(\mathrm{mod}\ b)}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{z a b\equiv N}}&{{(\mathrm{mod}\ c)}}\end{array}
$$  

have solutions $y_{0},z_{0}$ , respectively, $0<y_{0}<b$ , $0<x_{0}<c$ .  

Let $A=x_{0}b c+y_{0}c a+z_{0}a b$ . Then we have:  

$$
A\equiv x_{0}b c\equiv N{\pmod{a}},\quad A\equiv N{\pmod{b}},\quad A\equiv N{\pmod{c}}.
$$  

Since $a,b,c$ are pairwise respectively prime, we obtain $A\equiv N$ (mod abc).  

The number $A$ is a combination of required form. Since $x_{0}~\leq~a-1$ , $y_{0}\leq b-1$ , and $z_{0}\le c-1$ it follows that $A\leq3a b c-b c-c a-a b$ . Using $A\equiv N$ (mod abc), we may write $N=A+k a b c$ . In this sum $k\geq0$ , since $N>2a b c-b c-c a-a b$ . Therefore we found for $N$ , as it was required, the expression  

$$
N=(x_{0}+k a)b c+y_{0}c a+z_{0}a b
$$  

where $x_{0}+k a\ge0$ , $y_{0}\geq0$ , $z_{0}\geq0$ .  

Remark. One can prove that if $a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{k}\in\mathbb{Z}$ are positive integers such that $g c d(a_{1},\ldots,a_{k})=1$ , then any sufficiently large $n$ is a linear combination with nonnegative coefficients of $a_{1},\ldots,a_{k}$ . It is not known the smallest such $n$ for $k\geq4$ . This is the famous problem of Frobenius.

Let $q=g c d(z-x,(p+1)(z+x)+p)$ . Then $q|x$ , therefore $q|z$ , and therefore $q|p$ . On the other hand, $q\neq1$ , because otherwise both factors on the right hand side must be perfect squares, yet $(p+1)(z+x)+p\equiv3$ (mod 4). Thus $q=p$ and $p|x$ as desired.  

Now, write $x=p x_{1}$ and $z=p z_{1}$ to obtain  

$$

$$

(x,y,z,t)=\left(10-b,10+b,-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{d}{2},-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{d}{2}\right)

$$
(2000+60b^{2})-{\frac{1+3d^{2}}{4}}=1999,\quad{\mathrm{i.e.~}}d^{2}-80b^{2}=1.
$$  

The second equation is a Pell’s equation with solution $(d_{1},b_{1})=(9,1)$ . We can generate infinitely many more solutions by setting  

$$
\left(d_{n+1},b_{n+1}\right)=\left(9d_{n}+80b_{n},9b_{n}+d_{n}\right){\mathrm{for}}~n=1,2,3,\dots
$$  

This can be proven by induction, and it follows from a general recursion  

$$
\displaystyle\left(p_{n+1},q_{n+1}\right)=\left(p_{1}p_{n}+q_{1}q_{n}D,p_{1}q_{n}+q_{1}p_{n}\right)
$$  

for generating solutions to $p^{2}-D q^{2}=1$ given a nontrivial solution $(p_{1},q_{1})$ .  

A quick check also shows that each $d_{n}$ is odd. Thus because there are infinitely many solutions $(b_{n},d_{n})$ to the Pell’s equation (and with each $d_{n}$ odd), there are infinitely many integral solutions  

$$
\left(x_{n},y_{n},z_{n},t_{n}\right)=\left(10-b_{n},10+b_{n},-{\frac{1}{2}}-{\frac{d_{n}}{2}},-{\frac{1}{2}}+{\frac{d_{n}}{2}}\right)

$$
-2x_{0}^{2}\equiv4z_{0}^{2}{\pmod{7}},

Then $\left({\frac{x_{0}}{7}},{\frac{y_{0}}{7}},{\frac{z_{0}}{7}}\right)$ is also a solution, but $\left|{\frac{x_{0}}{7}}+{\frac{y_{0}}{7}}+{\frac{z_{0}}{7}}\right|<\left|x_{0}+y_{0}+z_{0}\right|$ , contradicting the minimality of $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ .

Because $z^{2}$ and $3y^{2}$ are relatively prime by assumption, $x-y$ and $x^{2}+x y+y^{2}$ must be relatively prime as well. Therefore, both $x-y$ and $x^{2}+x y+y^{2}$ are perfect squares.

Because $z^{2}$ and $3y^{2}$ are relatively prime by assumption, $x-y$ and $x^{2}+x y+y^{2}$ must be relatively prime as well. Therefore, both $x-y$ and $x^{2}+x y+y^{2}$ are perfect squares.  

Writing $a={\sqrt{x-y}}$ , we have

If $c\geq13$ then $c^{3}\geq2197>2001=a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}$ , which is false. If $c\leq7$ then $2001=a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\leq3\cdot343$ and again is false.

Hence $c=10$ and consequently $a^{3}+b^{3}=1001$ . If $b<c=10$ then $a\leq b\leq7$ and $1001=a^{3}+b^{3}\leq2\cdot7^{3}=2\cdot343$ , a contradiction. Thus $b=10$ and $a=1$ .  

Therefore $(a,b)\in\{(1,10,10),(10,1,10),(10,10,1)\}$ .

$$
\frac{n^{3}+1}{m n-1}
$$  

is an integer.  

( $35^{t h}$ IMO)  

","Solution. Let ${\frac{n^{3}+1}{m n-1}}=k$ , $k$ a positive integer.  

From $n^{3}+1=k(m n-1)$ , one obtains $k+1=n(k m-n^{2})$ . Thus, $n$ divides $k+1$ and by noting $k m-n^{2}=q$ one has $k=n q-1$ . Using this form of $k$ we have  

$$
n^{3}+1=(n q-1)(m n-1)\ \Leftrightarrow\ n(m q-n)=m+q.
$$  

Since $m+q>0$ it follows that $x=m q-n>0$ . Thus we have the system:  

$$
\left\{{\begin{array}{l}{x n=m+q}\\ {x+n=m q}\end{array}}\right.
$$  

By adding these equations we obtain:  

$$
x n+m q=x+n+m+q\Leftrightarrow x n+m q-x-n-m-q+2=2\Leftrightarrow
$$  

$$
(x-1)(n-1)+(m-1)(q-1)=2.
$$  

The equation  

$$
(x-1)(n-1)+(m-1)(q-1)=2
$$  

has only finite number of positive integer solutions. These are listed bellow:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{x=1,\ m-1=1,\ q-1=2\ \Rightarrow\ m=2,\ n=5.}\\ &{n=1,\ m-1=2,\ q-1=1\ \Rightarrow\ n=1,\ m=3.}\\ &{n=1,\ m-1=1,\ q-1=2\ \Rightarrow\ n=1,\ m=2.}\\ &{m=1,\ x-1=2,\ n-1=1\ \Rightarrow\ m=1,\ n=2.}\\ &{m=1,\ x-1=1,\ n-1=2\ \Rightarrow\ m=1,\ n=3.}\\ &{q=1,\ x-1=1,\ n-1=2\ \Rightarrow\ n=3,\ m=5.}\\ &{q=1,\ x-1=2,\ n-1=1\ \Rightarrow\ n=2,\ m=5.}\\ &{x-1=n-1=m-1=q-1=1\ \Rightarrow\ m=n=}\end{array}
$$  

Thus, we have obtained the following nine pairs $(m,n)$ : (5,3), (3,5), (5,2), (2,5), (3,1), (1,3), (2,1), (1,2), (2,2). All pairs are solutions of the problem.

Solution. Let ${\frac{n^{3}+1}{m n-1}}=k$ , $k$ a positive integer.  

From $n^{3}+1=k(m n-1)$ , one obtains $k+1=n(k m-n^{2})$ . Thus, $n$ divides $k+1$ and by noting $k m-n^{2}=q$ one has $k=n q-1$ . Using this form of $k$ we have  

$$
n^{3}+1=(n q-1)(m n-1)\ \Leftrightarrow\ n(m q-n)=m+q.
$$  

Since $m+q>0$ it follows that $x=m q-n>0$ . Thus we have the system:  

$$
\left\{{\begin{array}{l}{x n=m+q}\\ {x+n=m q}\end{array}}\right.

2^{b}a_{1}^{b}=a^{b}=(a+1)^{c}-1=((a+1)^{c_{1}}-1)((a+1)^{c_{1}}+1).

It follows that $g c d((a+1)^{c_{1}}-1,(a+1)^{c_{1}}+1)=2$ . Therefore, using the fact that $2a_{1}$ is a divisor of $(a+1)^{c_{1}}-1$ , we may conclude that

","Solution. One may assume that $a$ is square-free. Let us write $a\ =$ $2^{\in}q_{1}q_{2}\ldots q_{n}$ , where $q_{i}$ are different odd primes and $e\in\{0,1\}$ . Let us assume first that $n\geq1$ and consider some odd distinct primes $\mathbf{\Delta}^{\prime}\mathbf{1},\dots,\mathbf{\Delta}^{\prime}k$ each of them different from $q_{1},\ldots,q_{n}$ . We will show that there exists a prime $p$ , different from $\tau_{1},\ldots,\tau_{k}$ , such that $\left({\frac{a}{p}}\right)=-1$ . Let $s$ be a non quadratic residue modulo $q_{n}$ .  

Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find a positive integer $b$ such that

$$  

Now, write $b=p_{1}\ldots p_{m}$ with $p_{i}$ odd primes, not necessarily distinct. Using the quadratic reciprocity law, it follows immediately that  

$$
\prod_{i=1}^{m}\left({\frac{2}{p_{i}}}\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{m}(-1)^{{\frac{p_{i}^{2}-1}{8}}}=(-1)^{{\frac{b^{2}-1}{8}}}=1

and  

$$

$$

Thus, there exists $i\in\{1,2,\dots,m\}$ such that $\left({\frac{a}{p_{i}}}\right)=-1$ . Because $b\equiv1$ (mod $r_{i}$ ), $1\leq i\leq k$ we also have $p_{i}\in\{1,2,...\}\setminus\{r_{1},...,r_{k}\}$ and the claim is proved.

$2^{11}-1$ is not prime, it equals $23\cdot89$ . We claim this is the set of all possible values of $p$ .  

If some prime $p$ is not in $T$ , then look at the set $S=T$ . Then there must be some prime $q\not\in S$ less than 10000 such that  

$$
(q+1)|(M_{2}+1)(M_{3}+1)(M_{5}+1)(M_{7}+1)(M_{13}+1)=2^{30}.

","Solution. Let $S$ be the set of pairs $(n,m)$ of positive integers satisfying the equation  

$$
(x^{2}-x y-y^{2})^{2}=1.
$$  

If $n=m$ , then $n=m=1$ . Hence $(1,1)\in S$ . It is clear that (1,0) and (0,1) are also solutions to the equation (1).  

We will consider solutions $(n,m)$ with distinct components. Using Fermat’s method of infinite descent we obtain the following important result on the set $S$ .  

Lemma. If $(n,m)$ is a positive solution to the equation (1) and $n\neq m$ , then $n>m>n-m$ and $(m,n-m)$ is also a solution to (1).  

Proof. From $n^{2}-n m-m^{2}=\pm1$ , we obtain  

$$
n(n-m)=m^{2}\pm1>0.
$$  

Thus, $n>m$ . Also from $n^{2}-n m-m^{2}=\pm1$ , we obtain  

$$
m^{2}-m(n-m)-(n-m)^{2}=m^{2}+m n-n^{2}=\mp1.
$$  

Apply first part to solution $(m,n-m)$ and obtain $m>n-m$ .  

From the Lemma we deduce that any pair $(n,m)\in S$ gives rise to a pair $(m,n-m)\in M$ , which gives rise to a pair $(a+b,a)\in M$ . In this way by descending method $(n,m)\to(m,n-m)$ or by ascending method $(a,b)\rightarrow(a+b,a)$ , we obtain new solutions of the equation. The ascending and descending methods are reverse to one another.  

By applying the descending method to a pair $(n,m)\in S$ we can have only finitely many steps, because $n-m<m$ . Hence, in a finite number of steps we obtain a pair with $\mathit{n}=\mathit{m}_{\mathit{n}}$ , that is the pair (1,1). Thus, all solutions $(n,m)\in S$ are obtained from the pair (1,0) by applying the ascending method:  

$$
(1,0)\rightarrow(1,1)\rightarrow(2,1)\rightarrow(3,2)\rightarrow(5,3)\rightarrow...
$$  

The components of all such pairs are Fibonacci numbers $F_{n}$ . In this way the ascending transformation is exactly the following:  

$$
(F_{n},F_{n-1})\longrightarrow(F_{n+1},F_{n}).
$$  

Thus, to obtain the solution $(n,m)$ with maximum value of $n^{2}+m^{2}$ we consider the members of the Fibonacci sequence, not exceeding 1981:  

$0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597.$  

So, the required maximum is $987^{2}+1597^{2}$ .

","Solution. We will show that $x_{m}|x_{k m}$ , and then show that $\begin{array}{r}{g c d(x_{m},x_{m-1})=1}\end{array}$ .  

First, consider our sequence modulo $x_{m}$ for some $m$ . Each $x_{k+1}$ is uniquely determined by $x_{k},x_{k-1}$ and the parity of $k$ . Express each $x_{i}$ as a function $f_{i}(a,b)$ . We have $x_{i}\equiv f_{i}(a,b)x_{1}$ (mod $x_{m}$ ). Suppose $x_{r}\equiv0$ (mod $x_{m}$ ) for some $r$ . Since each term is a linear combination of two preceding ones,

Lemma. The function $f_{i}(a,b)$ is symmetric for any odd $i$ .  

Proof. We will prove also that $f_{i}(a,b)$ is symmetric function multiplied by $a$ . Now, we are to prove that $f_{2k-1}(a,b)$ is symmetric and $f_{2k-2}(a,b)=$ $a g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ , where $g_{2k-2}$ is symmetric too, for any positive integer $k$ . Proceed by induction on $k$ . For $k=1$ we have $f_{1}(a,b)=1$ and $g_{0}(a,b)=0$ .  

Suppose that $f_{2k-1}(a,b)$ is symmetric and $f_{2k-2}(a,b)=a g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ where $g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ is symmetric too. Then we can write

$$  

It shows that $f_{2k+1}$ and $g_{2k}$ are symmetric too and completes the step of induction. □  

Now we are to prove that $x_{m}|x_{k m}$ . Proceed by induction on $k$ . For $k=1$ this statement is true. Let $x_{m}|x_{k m}$ . Then from (1) and (2) putting $r=k m$ and $i=m$ , we obtain the following. If $k m$ is even, then  

$$
x_{m(k+1)}\equiv f_{m}(a,b)x_{k m+1}\equiv x_{m}x_{k m+1}\equiv0{\pmod{x_{m}}}.
$$  

For $k m$ odd $m$ is odd too and $f_{m}(a,b)=f_{m}(b,a)$ . Hence, we have  

$$
x_{m(k+1)}\equiv f_{m}(b,a)x_{k m+1}\equiv f_{m}(a,b)x_{k m+1}\equiv x_{m}x_{k m+1}\equiv0{\pmod{x_{m}}}.
$$  

So, for each nonnegative integers $k,m\ x_{m}|x_{k m}$ .  

Since the product $x_{n+1}x_{n+2}\ldots x_{n+m}$ has $m$ terms, one of their indices is divisible by $m$ and another’s index is divisible by $m-1$ . Thus both $x_{m}$ and $x_{m-1}$ divide the product. If we can show that $x_{m}$ is relatively prime to $x_{m-1}$ , we would be done. We will prove this by induction. For the base case, $x_{0}$ is relatively prime to $x_{1}$ . Now, $x_{2n}=a x_{2n-1}-x_{2n-2}$ . Any prime factor common to $x_{2n}$ and $x_{2n-1}$ must also divide $x_{2n-2}$ , but because $x_{2n-2}$ is relatively prime to $x_{2n-1}$ , there is no such prime factor. A similar argument holds for $x_{2n+1}$ because $x_{2n+1}=b x_{2n}-x_{2n-1}$ . Thus $x_{m}x_{m-1}|(x_{n+1}x_{n+2}\dots x_{n+m})$ .  

","Problem. Let $a,b$ be integers greater than 1. The sequence $x_{1}$ , $x_{2},\ldots$ is defined by the initial conditions $x_{0}=0$ , $x_{1}=1$ and the recursion  

$$
x_{2n}=a x_{2n-1}-x_{2n-2},\quad x_{2n+1}=b x_{2n}-x_{2n-1}
$$  

for $n\geq1$ . Prove that for any natural numbers $m$ and $n$ , the product $x_{n+m}x_{n+m-1}\ \cdot\ \cdot\ .x_{n+1}$ is divisible by $x_{m}x_{m-1}$ .  

(2001 St. Petersburg City Mathematical Olympiad)  

Solution. We will show that $x_{m}|x_{k m}$ , and then show that $\begin{array}{r}{g c d(x_{m},x_{m-1})=1}\end{array}$ .  

First, consider our sequence modulo $x_{m}$ for some $m$ . Each $x_{k+1}$ is uniquely determined by $x_{k},x_{k-1}$ and the parity of $k$ . Express each $x_{i}$ as a function $f_{i}(a,b)$ . We have $x_{i}\equiv f_{i}(a,b)x_{1}$ (mod $x_{m}$ ). Suppose $x_{r}\equiv0$ (mod $x_{m}$ ) for some $r$ . Since each term is a linear combination of two preceding ones,  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{x_{i+r}\equiv f_{i}(a,b)x_{r+1}\ }&{(\mathrm{mod}\ x_{m})\ \mathrm{if}\ m\ \mathrm{is\even},}\\ {x_{i+r}\equiv f_{i}(b,a)x_{r+1}\ }&{(\mathrm{mod}\ x_{m})\ \mathrm{if}\ m\ \mathrm{is\odd}.}\end{array}
$$  

Now we need to prove the following statement.  

Lemma. The function $f_{i}(a,b)$ is symmetric for any odd $i$ .  

Proof. We will prove also that $f_{i}(a,b)$ is symmetric function multiplied by $a$ . Now, we are to prove that $f_{2k-1}(a,b)$ is symmetric and $f_{2k-2}(a,b)=$ $a g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ , where $g_{2k-2}$ is symmetric too, for any positive integer $k$ . Proceed by induction on $k$ . For $k=1$ we have $f_{1}(a,b)=1$ and $g_{0}(a,b)=0$ .  

Suppose that $f_{2k-1}(a,b)$ is symmetric and $f_{2k-2}(a,b)=a g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ where $g_{2k-2}(a,b)$ is symmetric too. Then we can write  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{f_{2k}(a,b)=x_{2k}=a x_{2k-1}-x_{2k-2}}\\ {}&{}\\ {=a(x_{2k-1}-g(a,b))}\\ {}&{}\\ {=a(f_{2k-1}(a,b)-g_{2k-2}(a,b))}\end{array}
$$  

and  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{f_{2k+1}(a,b)=x_{2k+1}=a b x_{2k-1}-b x_{2k-2}-x_{2k-1}}\\ &{\qquad=a b x_{2k-1}-a b q-x_{2k-1}}\\ &{\qquad=(a b-1)f_{2k-1}(a,b)-a b g_{2k-2}(a,b).}\end{array}
$$  

It shows that $f_{2k+1}$ and $g_{2k}$ are symmetric too and completes the step of induction. □  

Now we are to prove that $x_{m}|x_{k m}$ . Proceed by induction on $k$ . For $k=1$ this statement is true. Let $x_{m}|x_{k m}$ . Then from (1) and (2) putting $r=k m$ and $i=m$ , we obtain the following. If $k m$ is even, then  

$$
x_{m(k+1)}\equiv f_{m}(a,b)x_{k m+1}\equiv x_{m}x_{k m+1}\equiv0{\pmod{x_{m}}}.
$$  

For $k m$ odd $m$ is odd too and $f_{m}(a,b)=f_{m}(b,a)$ . Hence, we have  

$$
x_{m(k+1)}\equiv f_{m}(b,a)x_{k m+1}\equiv f_{m}(a,b)x_{k m+1}\equiv x_{m}x_{k m+1}\equiv0{\pmod{x_{m}}}.
$$  

So, for each nonnegative integers $k,m\ x_{m}|x_{k m}$ .  

Since the product $x_{n+1}x_{n+2}\ldots x_{n+m}$ has $m$ terms, one of their indices is divisible by $m$ and another’s index is divisible by $m-1$ . Thus both $x_{m}$ and $x_{m-1}$ divide the product. If we can show that $x_{m}$ is relatively prime to $x_{m-1}$ , we would be done. We will prove this by induction. For the base case, $x_{0}$ is relatively prime to $x_{1}$ . Now, $x_{2n}=a x_{2n-1}-x_{2n-2}$ . Any prime factor common to $x_{2n}$ and $x_{2n-1}$ must also divide $x_{2n-2}$ , but because $x_{2n-2}$ is relatively prime to $x_{2n-1}$ , there is no such prime factor. A similar argument holds for $x_{2n+1}$ because $x_{2n+1}=b x_{2n}-x_{2n-1}$ . Thus $x_{m}x_{m-1}|(x_{n+1}x_{n+2}\dots x_{n+m})$ .

The sequence $a_{1},a_{2},\dotsc$ cannot be strictly decreasing because each $\boldsymbol{a}_{n}$ is a positive integer, so there exists a smallest $k\geq1$ such that $a_{k+1}\geq a_{k}$ . Define a new sequence $b_{1},b_{2},\ldots$ by $b_{n}=a_{n+k-1}$ , so $b_{2}\geq b_{1}$ , $b_{n+2}=|3b_{n+1}-2b_{n}|$ for $n\geq1$ , and $b_{1},b_{2},\ldots$ has only a finite number of composite terms.

2(1999-1)+{\frac{1999\cdot1998}{2}}c\equiv0

implies $-4+1001c\equiv0$ , hence $c\equiv4$ (mod 2000).

$(n-1)(n+1)$ is divisible by 8 exactly when $n$ is odd, and it is divisible by 125 exactly when either $n-1$ or $n+1$ is divisible by 125. The smallest $n\geq2$ satisfying these requirements is $n=249$ .

","Solution. (a) We will first prove the sum is divisible by 4, then by 5. Note that $a_{n+2}\equiv a_{n+1}+a_{n}$ (mod 4) whether $n$ is odd or even. The sequence modulo 4 thus proceeds 1, 3, $0$ , 3, 3, 2, 1, 3,. . . in a cycle of 6, so the sum of squares of any six consecutive terms in congruent to $1^{2}+3^{2}+0^{2}+3^{2}+$ $3^{2}+2^{2}\equiv0$ (mod 4).  

Now let us work modulo 5, in which case $a_{n+2}\equiv a_{n+1}+4a_{n}$ if $n$ is even and $a_{n+2}\equiv4a_{n+1}$ if $n$ is odd. Hence the sequence modulo 5 proceeds $^{1}$ , 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3,. . . in a cycle of 8 beginning with $a_{2}$ .

(b) Notice that $a_{2n+1}\equiv5a_{2n-1}$ (mod 9). Since $a_{1}=3$ , by induction $a_{2n+1}\equiv3$ (mod 9) for all $n$ . However, no perfect square is congruent to 3 modulo 9, since any square divisible by 3 is also divisible by 9. Hence $a_{2n+1}$ is not a square.

(2002 St. Petersburg City Mathematical Olympiad)  

","Solution. Answer: $a_{0}=3\cdot2^{2002}-1$  

We will first show that this value actually satisfies the condition $a_{2002}=2$ and $a_{i}\neq2$ for any $i<2002$ . Applying the first rule, $a_{n+1}={\frac{a_{n}-1}{2002}}$ times will show that $a_{2002}$ is in fact 2 and $a_{i}$ is actually greater than 2 for all $i<2002$ .  

Lemma. For $n\leq2000$ , if $a_{n}$ is not an integer, $a_{n}=p_{n}/q_{n}$ , where $p_{n}$ and $q_{n}$ are positive odd integers, $(p,q)=1$ and $q>1$ .  

Proof. We proceed by using induction. Case case: $n=2000$ . a2000 is either $5/7$ or $1/5$ . Suppose $a_{n+1}=p/q$ . Then:  

Case $\mathit{1}$ . $a_{n}=2p/q+1$ . Then $a_{n}=(2p+q)/q$ . Suppose $d|(2p+q)$ and $d|q$ . Then $d|(2p+q-q)$ or $d|2p$ . Since is odd, $d$ must also be odd. So $q$ $(d,2)=1$ and therefore $d|p$ . Because $d|p,d|q$ , and $(p,q)=1$ , $d$ must equal 1. Therefore $(2p+q,q)=1$ and since $2p+q\mathrm{a}$ and $q$ are both odd as well, $a_{n}$ satisfies the conditions stated in the lemma, thus completing the inductive step.  

Case 2. an = p / $a_{n}=\frac{p}{q}/\left(2+\frac{p}{q}\right)=\frac{p}{2q+p}$ . Again suppose d divides both the numerator $p$ and denominator $2p+q$ . Then $d|(2p+q-p)$ or $d|2q$ . But since $p$ is odd, $d$ is odd, and so $d|q$ . Because $(p,q)=1$ , $d$ is equal to 1 and so $(p,2q+p)=1$ . Since $p$ and $2q+p$ are odd and are relatively prime, $a_{n}$ satisfies the conditions and completes the proof.  

We must now only consider the case where $a_{2001}=1/2$ . In this case, $a_{2000}$ is either 2 or $5/7$ . If it is 2, the conditions of the problem are violated. The lemma says that from the $5/7$ , we will never see an integer value for any previous term.

Proof. We proceed by using induction. Case case: $n=2000$ . a2000 is either $5/7$ or $1/5$ . Suppose $a_{n+1}=p/q$ . Then:  

Case $\mathit{1}$ . $a_{n}=2p/q+1$ . Then $a_{n}=(2p+q)/q$ . Suppose $d|(2p+q)$ and $d|q$ . Then $d|(2p+q-q)$ or $d|2p$ . Since is odd, $d$ must also be odd. So $q$ $(d,2)=1$ and therefore $d|p$ . Because $d|p,d|q$ , and $(p,q)=1$ , $d$ must equal 1. Therefore $(2p+q,q)=1$ and since $2p+q\mathrm{a}$ and $q$ are both odd as well, $a_{n}$ satisfies the conditions stated in the lemma, thus completing the inductive step.  

Case 2. an = p / $a_{n}=\frac{p}{q}/\left(2+\frac{p}{q}\right)=\frac{p}{2q+p}$ . Again suppose d divides both the numerator $p$ and denominator $2p+q$ . Then $d|(2p+q-p)$ or $d|2q$ . But since $p$ is odd, $d$ is odd, and so $d|q$ . Because $(p,q)=1$ , $d$ is equal to 1 and so $(p,2q+p)=1$ . Since $p$ and $2q+p$ are odd and are relatively prime, $a_{n}$ satisfies the conditions and completes the proof.  

We must now only consider the case where $a_{2001}=1/2$ . In this case, $a_{2000}$ is either 2 or $5/7$ . If it is 2, the conditions of the problem are violated. The lemma says that from the $5/7$ , we will never see an integer value for any previous term.

","Solution. The only such sequence is 2,2,2,. . . which clearly satisfies the given condition.  

Let $g_{n}=g c d(a_{n},a_{n+1})$ . Then $g_{n+1}$ divides both $\boldsymbol a_{n+1}$ and $\boldsymbol{a}_{n+2}$ , so it divides $g_{n}a_{n+2}-a_{n-1}=a_{n}$ as well. Thus $g_{n+1}$ divides both $a_{n}$ and $\boldsymbol{a}_{n+1}$ , and it divides their greatest common divisor $g_{n}$ .  

Therefore, the $g_{i}$ form a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers and eventually equal some positive constant $g$ . At this point, the $a_{i}$ satisfy the recursion  

$$
g a_{n}=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}.
$$  

If $g=1$ , then $a_{n}=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}>a_{n-1}$ so the sequence is increasing and unbounded.  

If $g\geq3$ , then  

$$
a_{n}={\frac{a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}}{g}}<{\frac{a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}}{2}}\leq\operatorname*{max}\{a_{n-1},a_{n-2}\}.
$$  

Similarly, $a_{n+1}<\operatorname*{max}\{a_{n-1},a_{n}\}\leq\operatorname*{max}\{a_{n-2},a_{n-1}\}$ , so that  

$$
\operatorname*{max}\{a_{n},a_{n+1}\}<\operatorname*{max}\{a_{n-2},a_{n-1}\}.
$$  

Therefore the maximum values of successive pairs of terms form an infinite decreasing sequence of positive integers, a contradiction.  

Thus $g=2$ and eventually we have $2a_{n}=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$ or $\begin{array}{r}{a_{n}-a_{n-1}=}\end{array}$ $-{\frac{1}{2}}(a_{n-1}-a_{n-2})$ . This implies that $a_{i}-a_{i-1}$ converges to $0$ and that the $a_{i}$ are eventually constant as well. From $2a_{n}=\frac{a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}}{g c d(a_{n-1},a_{n-2})}$ this constant must be 2.  

Now if $a_{n}=a_{n+1}=\operatorname{2}$ for $n>1$ , then $g c d(a_{n-1},a_{n})=g c d(a_{n-1},2)$ either equals 1 or 2. Now  

$$

$$  

implying either that $a_{n-1}~=~0$ , which is impossible, or that $a_{n-1}\ =\ 2$ .   
Therefore all the $a_{i}$ equal 2, as claimed.

For any positive integer $m$ , write $m=3^{r}(3k+s)$ for nonnegative integers $r,k,s$ , with $s\in\{1,2\}$ , and define $r_{m}=r$ and $s_{m}=s$ .

These claims imply the desired result, and they are easily verified for $t=1$ . Now supposing they are true for $t$ , we show they are true for $t+1$ .  

For any positive integer $m$ , write $m=3^{r}(3k+s)$ for nonnegative integers $r,k,s$ , with $s\in\{1,2\}$ , and define $r_{m}=r$ and $s_{m}=s$ .  

Then for $m<3^{t}$ , observe that

$$
x_{2\cdot3^{t+1}-1}=-{\frac{3^{t+1}-1}{2}}.

Combining this with (i) and (ii) from the induction hypothesis proves the claims for $t+1$ . This completes the proof.

Prove that there exists a sequence $b_{1},b_{2},\dotsc$ of natural numbers such that $a_{n}=\prod_{d\mid n}b_{d}$ for all integers $n\geq1$ .

","Solution. For each $n$ , let $\operatorname{rad}(n)$ denote the largest square-free divisor of $n$ (i.e. the product of all distinct prime factors of $n$ ). We let $b_{n}$ equal to the ratio of the following two numbers:  

$E_{n}$ , the product of all $\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$ such that $d$ is square-free, divides $n$ , and has an even number of prime factors.   
$O_{n}$ , the product of all $\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$ such that $d$ is square-free, divides $n$ , and has an odd number of prime factors.  

Lemma 1. $\prod_{d\mid a_{n}}b_{d}=a_{n}.$  

Proof. Fix $n$ , and observe that $\prod_{d\mid n}b_{n}$ equals  

$$
{\frac{\displaystyle\prod_{d\mid n}E_{d}}{\displaystyle\prod_{d\mid n}O_{d}}}.
$$  

In the numerator of $(*)$ , each $E_{d}$ is the product of $a_{m}$ such that $m|d$ . Also, $d|n$ , implying that the numerator is the product of various $a_{m}$ such that $m|n$ . For fixed $m$ that divides $n$ , how many times does $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator $\prod_{d\mid n}E_{d}$ of (∗)?  

If $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ and $d|n$ , then let $t=d/m$ . By the definition of $E_{d}$ , we know that (i) $t$ is square-free and (ii) $t$ has an even number of prime factors. Because $d|n$ and $t=d/m$ , we further know that (iii) $t$ divides $n/m$ .  

Conversely, suppose that $t$ is any positive integer satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), and write $d=t m$ . By (iii), $d$ is a divisor of $n$ . Also, $t$ is square-free by (i), is a divisor of $d$ , and has an even number of prime factors by (ii). Thus, $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ .  

Suppose that $n/m$ has $\it l$ distinct prime factors. Then it has ${\binom{l}{0}}+{\binom{l}{2}}+$ . factors $t$ satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), implying that $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator of $(*)$ exactly  

$$
{\binom{l}{0}}+{\binom{l}{2}}+\dots
$$  

times. Similarly, $a_{m}$ appears in the denominator of $(*)$ exactly  

$$
{\binom{l}{1}}+{\binom{l}{3}}+...
$$  

times. If $m<n$ , then $l\geq1$ and these expressions are equal, so that the $a_{m}$ ’s in the numerator and denominator of $(*)$ cancel each other out. If $m=n$ , then ${\mathit{l}}=0$ , so that $a_{n}$ appears in the numerator once and in the denominator zero times. Therefore,  

$$
\prod_{d|n}b_{d}=\frac{\displaystyle\prod_{d|n}E_{d}}{\displaystyle\prod_{d|n}O_{d}}=a_{n},
$$  

as desired.  

Lemma 2. For any integer $\alpha$ that divides some term in $a_{1},a_{2},\dotsb$ , there exists an integer d such that  

$$
\alpha|a_{n}\ \Leftrightarrow\ d|n.
$$  

Proof. Of all the integers $n$ such that $\alpha|a_{n}$ , let $d$ be the smallest.  

If $\alpha|a_{n}$ , then $\alpha|g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}$ . By the minimal definition of $d$ , $g c d(d,n)\geq d$ . But $g c d(d,n)|n$ as well, implying that $g c d(d,n)=d$ . Hence, $d|n$ .  

If $d|n$ , then $g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}=a_{d}$ . Thus, $\displaystyle a_{d}|a_{n}$ . Because $\alpha|a_{d}$ , it follows that $\alpha|a_{n}$ as well. □  

Lemma 3. For each positive integer $n$ , $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer.  

Proof. Fix $n$ . Call an integer $d$ a top divisor (resp. a bottom divisor) if $d|n,n/d$ is square-free, and $n/d$ has an even (resp. odd) number of prime factors. By definition, $E_{d}$ is the product of $\mathit{a}_{d}$ over all top divisors $d$ , and $O_{d}$ is the product of $\boldsymbol{a}_{d}$ over all bottom divisors $d$ .  

Fix any prime $p$ . We show that $p$ divides $E_{n}$ at least as many times as it divides $O_{n}$ . To do this, it suffices to show the following for any positive integer $k$ :  

(1) The number of top divisors $d$ with $\boldsymbol a_{n/d}$ divisible by $p^{k}$ is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ with divisible by $p^{k}$ . $\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$  

Let $k$ be any positive integer. If $p^{k}$ divides none of $a_{1},a_{2},\dotsc$ , then (1) holds trivially. Otherwise, by the previous lemma, there exists an integer $d_{0}$ such that  

$$
p^{k}|a_{m}\ \Leftrightarrow\ d_{0}|m.
$$  

Hence, to show (1) it suffices to show:  

(2) The number of top divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ , is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ .  

If $d_{0}\nmid n$ , then (2) holds because $d_{0}$ does not divide $n/d$ for any divisor $d$ of $n$ , including top or bottom divisors.  

Otherwise, $d_{0}|n$ . For which top and bottom divisors $d$ does $d_{0}$ divide $n/d$ ? Precisely those for which $d$ divides $n/d_{0}$ . If $n/d_{0}$ has $l\geq1$ distinct prime factors, then there are as many top divisors with this property as there are bottom divisors, namely  

$$
{\binom{l}{0}}+{\binom{l}{2}}+\cdots=2^{l-1}={\binom{l}{1}}+{\binom{l}{3}}+\ldots
$$  

If instead $d_{0}=n$ and $\mathit{l}\mathit{\Theta}=0$ , then the top divisor 1 is the only value $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ . In either case, there are at least as many top divisors $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ as there are bottom divisors with the same property. Therefore, (2) holds. This completes the proof. □  

Therefore, $a_{n}=\prod_{d\mid n}b_{d}$ , and $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer for each $n$ .  

Alternative solution. (Gabriel Dospinescu) Let us define $b_{1}=a_{1}$ and $b_{n}=\frac{a_{n}}{l c m a_{d}}$ for $n>1$ . Of course, if $d|n$ , then $\displaystyle a_{d}|a_{n}$ and so lcm ad|an and $\begin{array}{l}{l c m a_{d}|a_{n}}\\ {d|n}\\ {d\neq n}\end{array}$ d|n $d\neq n$ $b_{n}\in\mathbb{Z}$ .  

Now comes the hard part, proving that $\prod_{d\mid n}b_{d}=a_{n}$ , which is the same as  

$$
\prod_{\begin{array}{l}{d\left|n}\\ {d\neq n}\end{array}\right.}b_{d}=l c m a_{d}.}\\ {d\neq n}\end{array}
$$  

We will prove (1) by strong induction. For $n=1$ it is clear Now, for all $d|n$ , $d\neq n$ , by inductive hypothesis we have  

$$
a_{d}=\prod_{d^{\prime}\mid d\atop d\neq n}b_{d^{\prime}}\mid\prod_{d\mid n\atop d\neq n}b_{d},
$$  

thus $\prod b_{d}$ is a multiple of $l c m a_{d}$ . It remains to prove that $\prod_{\begin{array}{l}{d|n}\\ {d\neq n}\end{array}}b_{d}|\operatorname*{lc}m a_{d}$ $d|n$ $\stackrel{d|n}{d\neq n}$ $d\neq n$  

The essential observation is:  

Lemma. If $g c d(b_{u},b_{v})>1$ , then $u|v$ or $_{v|u}$  

Proof. We may assume that $u<v$ . Assume that $u$ does not divide $v$ . Then  

$$
b_{u}=\frac{a_{u}}{l c m a_{d}}|\frac{a_{u}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}\nonumber
$$  

(since $g c d(u,v)\neq u$ ) and also  

$$
b_{v}|\frac{a_{v}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}.
$$  

But then  

$$
g c d(b_{u},b_{v})|g c d\left(\frac{a_{u}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}},\frac{a_{v}}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}\right)=\frac{g c d(a_{u},a_{v})}{a_{g c d(u,v)}}.
$$  

Now, let $p$ be a prime number and let $i_{1}<i_{2}<\dots<i_{k}$ such that $i_{q}|n$ , $i_{q}\neq n$ for all $q$ and $b_{i_{q}}$ has the exponent of $p$ equal to $e_{q}\geq1$ and any $b_{d}$ with $d|n$ , $d\neq n$ , $d\neq i_{q}$ for all $q$ is not a multiple of $p$ . From the lemma we find $i_{1}|i_{2}|\dots|i_{k}$ . But then from the inductive hypothesis we have  

$$
a_{i_{k}}=\prod_{d|i_{k}}b_{d}
$$  

is a multiple of $b_{i_{1}}b_{i_{2}}\ldots b_{i_{k}}$ , thus $l c m a_{d}$ has the exponent of $p$ greater than $\scriptstyle d\mid n\mid\$ $d\not=n$   
or equal to the exponent of $p$ in $\prod b_{d}$ . This ends the solution. d|n d=n

Proof. Fix $n$ , and observe that $\prod_{d\mid n}b_{n}$ equals  

$$

Conversely, suppose that $t$ is any positive integer satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), and write $d=t m$ . By (iii), $d$ is a divisor of $n$ . Also, $t$ is square-free by (i), is a divisor of $d$ , and has an even number of prime factors by (ii). Thus, $a_{m}$ appears in $E_{d}$ .  

Suppose that $n/m$ has $\it l$ distinct prime factors. Then it has ${\binom{l}{0}}+{\binom{l}{2}}+$ . factors $t$ satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), implying that $a_{m}$ appears in the numerator of $(*)$ exactly

Proof. Of all the integers $n$ such that $\alpha|a_{n}$ , let $d$ be the smallest.  

If $\alpha|a_{n}$ , then $\alpha|g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}$ . By the minimal definition of $d$ , $g c d(d,n)\geq d$ . But $g c d(d,n)|n$ as well, implying that $g c d(d,n)=d$ . Hence, $d|n$ .  

If $d|n$ , then $g c d(a_{d},a_{n})=a_{g c d(d,n)}=a_{d}$ . Thus, $\displaystyle a_{d}|a_{n}$ . Because $\alpha|a_{d}$ , it follows that $\alpha|a_{n}$ as well. □  

Lemma 3. For each positive integer $n$ , $b_{n}=E_{n}/O_{n}$ is an integer.  

Proof. Fix $n$ . Call an integer $d$ a top divisor (resp. a bottom divisor) if $d|n,n/d$ is square-free, and $n/d$ has an even (resp. odd) number of prime factors. By definition, $E_{d}$ is the product of $\mathit{a}_{d}$ over all top divisors $d$ , and $O_{d}$ is the product of $\boldsymbol{a}_{d}$ over all bottom divisors $d$ .  

Fix any prime $p$ . We show that $p$ divides $E_{n}$ at least as many times as it divides $O_{n}$ . To do this, it suffices to show the following for any positive integer $k$ :  

(1) The number of top divisors $d$ with $\boldsymbol a_{n/d}$ divisible by $p^{k}$ is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ with divisible by $p^{k}$ . $\boldsymbol{a}_{n/d}$

Hence, to show (1) it suffices to show:  

(2) The number of top divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ , is greater than or equal to the number of bottom divisors $d$ such that $d_{0}|(n/d)$ .  

If $d_{0}\nmid n$ , then (2) holds because $d_{0}$ does not divide $n/d$ for any divisor $d$ of $n$ , including top or bottom divisors.  

Otherwise, $d_{0}|n$ . For which top and bottom divisors $d$ does $d_{0}$ divide $n/d$ ? Precisely those for which $d$ divides $n/d_{0}$ . If $n/d_{0}$ has $l\geq1$ distinct prime factors, then there are as many top divisors with this property as there are bottom divisors, namely

If instead $d_{0}=n$ and $\mathit{l}\mathit{\Theta}=0$ , then the top divisor 1 is the only value $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ . In either case, there are at least as many top divisors $d$ with $d|(n/d_{0})$ as there are bottom divisors with the same property. Therefore, (2) holds. This completes the proof. □

(C_{m+1}-C_{k})(C_{m+2}-C_{k})\dots(C_{m+n}-C_{k})
$$  

is divisible by $\Y_{1}C_{2}\ldots c_{n}$ .  

Solution. We use the identity:  

$$
C_{p}-C_{q}=p(p+1)-q(q+1)=(p-q)(p+q+1),
$$  

which is valid for all positive integers $p$ and $q$ . Then one has:  

$$
\gamma_{k}=(m-k+i)(m+k+i+1),\forall\ i=1,2,...,n
$$  

For the given products we obtain respectively, the formulas  

$$
(C_{m+1}-C_{k})\ldots(C_{m+n}-C_{k})=\prod_{i=1}^{n}(m-k+i)\prod_{i=1}^{n}(m+k+1+i)
$$  

$$
C_{1}C_{2}\ldots C_{n}=n!(n+1)!
$$  

Their quotient is the product of two rational fractions:  

$$
\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{n}(m-k+i)}{n!}\quad{\mathrm{and}}\quad{\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{n}(m+k+1+i)}{(n+1)!}}
$$  

It is known that the product of any consecutive integers is divisible by $n!$ and their quotient is zero or a binomial coefficient, possible multiplied by $-1$ . In our case we have  

$$
{\frac{1}{n!}}\prod_{i=1}^{n}(m-k+i)={\binom{m-k+n}{n}}.
$$  

For the second fraction, a factor is missing to the numerator. We support our argument by using that $m+k+1$ is a prime number greater than $n+1$ :  

$$
{\frac{1}{(n+1)!}}\prod_{i=1}^{n}(m+k+1+i)={\frac{1}{m+k+1}}\cdot{\frac{1}{(n+1)!}}\prod_{i=0}^{n}(m+k+1+i)
$$  

$$
=\frac{1}{m+k+1}{\binom{m_{k}+n+1}{n+1}}.
$$  

The binomial coefficient $\binom{m+k+n+1}{n+1}$ is an integer number which is divisible by $m+k+1$ , then our number is integer.

We prove that the set of positive integers $k$ for which the claim holds is exactly the set of primes.  

Suppose now that $k$ is not a prime. Then consider two cases:

Suppose, on the contrary, that there is a positive integer $n$ such that for all $1\leq i\leq n-1,\binom{n}{i}$ is divisible by $p^{r}$ . Clearly, $n$ is divisible by $p^{r}$ , and we write $n=p^{\alpha}\beta$ for some $\beta$ with $g c d(\beta,p)=1$ . Take $i=p^{\alpha-1}$ . Then  

$$

$$  

Now, since $\alpha-\gamma-1\geq1$ , we have $\beta p^{\alpha-\gamma}-\delta$ and $p^{\alpha-\gamma-1}-\delta$ coprime with $p$ . In this case, the power of $p$ in the above numerator and the denominator is $\gamma$ , and the power of $p$ in the above product of fractions, which is an integer, is 1. This contradicts the assumption that $p^{r}|n$ .  

(b) $k$ is divisible by at least two distinct primes . Assume by contra$p,q$ diction that there is a positive integer $n$ as required. Then $n$ is divisible by $p q$ and we can write $n=p^{\alpha}\beta$ where ${\mathit{g c d}}(p,\beta)=1$ and $\beta>1$ (since $q$ divides $\beta$ ). Take $i=p^{\alpha}$ . Then

(1999 Hungarian-Israel Mathematical Competition)  

","Solution. The statement is false. To prove this, take $k=4$ and assume by contradiction that there exists a positive integer $n>1$ for which $\binom{n}{i}$ is divisible by 4 for every $1\leq i\leq n-1$ . Then  

$$
0\equiv\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{\binom{n}{i}}=2^{n}-2\equiv-2{\pmod{4}},
$$  

a contradiction.  

Remark. As we have already seen in Problem 10.1.13, the set of all such integers $k$ is precisely the set of primes. Here we give an argument based on Kummer’s Theorem.  

Now, suppose the claim holds for some $k>1$ with the number $n$ . If some prime $p$ divides $k$ , the claim must also hold for $p$ with the number $n$ . Thus $n$ must equal a prime power $p^{m}$ where $m\geq1$ . Then $k=p^{r}$ for some $r\geq1$ as well, because if two primes $p$ and $q$ divided $k$ then $n$ would equal a perfect power of both $p$ and $q$ , which is impossible.  

Choose $i=p^{m-1}$ . Kummer’s Theorem states that $p^{t}|\binom{n}{i}$ if and only if $t$ is less than or equal to the number of carries in the addition $(n-i)+i$ in base $p$ . There is only such carry, between the $p^{m-1}$ and $p^{m}$ places:  

$$
\frac{\begin{array}{r c l l l}{\displaystyle{+}}&{\displaystyle{\begin{array}{r c l l l l}{\displaystyle{1}}&{\displaystyle{0}}&{\displaystyle{0}}&{\displaystyle{\ldots}}&{\displaystyle{0}}\\ {\displaystyle{p-1}}&{\displaystyle{0}}&{\displaystyle{0}}&{\displaystyle{\ldots}}&{\displaystyle{0}}\end{array}}}\end{array}
$$

Therefore pm 1− j contributes one factor of $p$ to $\binom{n}{i}$ when $j=0$ and zero factors of $p$ when $j>0$ . Thus $p^{2}$ does not divide binomi, and hence again $r\leq1$ .)  
","Problem. Prove or disprove the following claim: For any integer $k\geq2$ , there exists an integer $n\geq2$ such that the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{i}$ is divisible by $k$ for any $1\leq i\leq n-1$ .  

(1999 Hungarian-Israel Mathematical Competition)  

Solution. The statement is false. To prove this, take $k=4$ and assume by contradiction that there exists a positive integer $n>1$ for which $\binom{n}{i}$ is divisible by 4 for every $1\leq i\leq n-1$ . Then  

$$
0\equiv\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{\binom{n}{i}}=2^{n}-2\equiv-2{\pmod{4}},
$$  

a contradiction.  

Remark. As we have already seen in Problem 10.1.13, the set of all such integers $k$ is precisely the set of primes. Here we give an argument based on Kummer’s Theorem.  

Now, suppose the claim holds for some $k>1$ with the number $n$ . If some prime $p$ divides $k$ , the claim must also hold for $p$ with the number $n$ . Thus $n$ must equal a prime power $p^{m}$ where $m\geq1$ . Then $k=p^{r}$ for some $r\geq1$ as well, because if two primes $p$ and $q$ divided $k$ then $n$ would equal a perfect power of both $p$ and $q$ , which is impossible.  

Choose $i=p^{m-1}$ . Kummer’s Theorem states that $p^{t}|\binom{n}{i}$ if and only if $t$ is less than or equal to the number of carries in the addition $(n-i)+i$ in base $p$ . There is only such carry, between the $p^{m-1}$ and $p^{m}$ places:  

$$
\frac{\begin{array}{r c l l l}{\displaystyle{+}}&{\displaystyle{\begin{array}{r c l l l l}{\displaystyle{1}}&{\displaystyle{0}}&{\displaystyle{0}}&{\displaystyle{\ldots}}&{\displaystyle{0}}\\ {\displaystyle{p-1}}&{\displaystyle{0}}&{\displaystyle{0}}&{\displaystyle{\ldots}}&{\displaystyle{0}}\end{array}}}\end{array}
$$  

Thus, we must have $r\leq1$ and $k$ must be prime, as claimed. (Alternatively, for $n=p^{m}$ and $i=p^{m-1}$ we have  

$$
{\binom{n}{i}}=\prod_{j=0}^{p^{m-1}-1}{\frac{p^{m}-j}{p^{m-1}-j}}.
$$  

When $j=0$ then ${\frac{p^{m}-j}{p^{m-1}-j}}=p$ . Otherwise, $0<j<p^{m-1}$ so that if $p^{t}<$ $p^{m-1}$ is the highest power of $p$ dividing $j$ , then it is also the highest power of p dividing both pm − j and pm−1 − j. Therefore pm 1− j contributes one factor of $p$ to $\binom{n}{i}$ when $j=0$ and zero factors of $p$ when $j>0$ . Thus $p^{2}$ does not divide binomi, and hence again $r\leq1$ .)

(1998 Iranian Mathematical Olympiad)  

","Solution. If $x=1$ , then $a=b=1$ and we are done. So we may assume n $x>1$ . Write $x=\prod_{i=1}p_{i}^{\gamma_{i}}$ , where the $p_{i}$ are the distinct prime factors of $x$ . Since $a$ and $b$ divide $x^{a+b}$ , we have $a=\prod p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$ and $b=\prod p_{i}^{\beta_{i}}$ for some nonnegative integers $\alpha_{i},\beta_{i}$ .  

First suppose that some $\beta_{i}$ is zero, that is, $p_{i}$ does not divide $b$ . Then the given equation implies that $\gamma_{i}(a+b)=\alpha_{i}b$ , so that $(\alpha_{i}-\gamma_{i})b=a\gamma_{i}$ . Now $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$ divides $a$ but is coprime to $b$ , so $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$ divides $\alpha_{i}-\gamma_{i}$ also. But $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}>\alpha_{i}$ for $\alpha_{i}>0$ , contradiction. We conclude that $\beta_{i}>0$ .  

Now from the fact that  

$$
\gamma_{i}(a+b)=\beta_{i}+b\alpha_{i}
$$  

and the fact that $p^{\beta_{i}}$ does not divide $\beta_{i}$ (again for size reasons), we deduce that $p^{\beta_{i}}$ also does not divide $a$ , that is, $\alpha_{i}<\beta_{i}$ for all $i$ and so $a$ divides $b$ . Moreover, the equation above implies that $a$ divides $\beta_{i}$ , so we may write $b=c^{a}$ with $c\geq2$ a positive integer.  

Write $x/a=p/q$ in lowest terms (so $g c d(p,q)=1$ ). Then the original equation becomes $x^{a}p^{b}=b q^{b}$ . Now $p^{b}$ must divide $b$ , which can only occur if $p=1$ . That is, $x$ divides $a$ .  

If $x\neq a$ , then there exists $i$ with $\alpha_{i}\geq\gamma_{i}+1$ , so  

$$
\gamma_{i}(a+b)=\beta_{i}+\alpha_{i}b\geq(\gamma_{i}+1)b
$$  

and so $\gamma_{i}a>b$ . On the other hand, $a$ is divisible by $p_{i}^{\gamma_{i}}$ , so in particular $a\geq\gamma_{i}$ . Thus $a^{2}>b=c^{a}$ , or ${\sqrt{c}}<a^{1/a}$ ; however, $a^{1/a}<{\sqrt{2}}$ for $a\geq5$ , so this can only hold for $c=2$ and $a=3$ , in which case $b=8$ is not divisible by $a$ , contrary to our earlier observation.  

Thus $x=a$ , and from the original equation we get $b=x^{x}$ , as desired.  

","Problem. Let $x,a,b$ be positive integers such that $x^{a+b}=a^{b}b$ . Prove that $a=x$ and $b=x^{x}$ .  

(1998 Iranian Mathematical Olympiad)  

Solution. If $x=1$ , then $a=b=1$ and we are done. So we may assume n $x>1$ . Write $x=\prod_{i=1}p_{i}^{\gamma_{i}}$ , where the $p_{i}$ are the distinct prime factors of $x$ . Since $a$ and $b$ divide $x^{a+b}$ , we have $a=\prod p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$ and $b=\prod p_{i}^{\beta_{i}}$ for some nonnegative integers $\alpha_{i},\beta_{i}$ .  

First suppose that some $\beta_{i}$ is zero, that is, $p_{i}$ does not divide $b$ . Then the given equation implies that $\gamma_{i}(a+b)=\alpha_{i}b$ , so that $(\alpha_{i}-\gamma_{i})b=a\gamma_{i}$ . Now $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$ divides $a$ but is coprime to $b$ , so $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$ divides $\alpha_{i}-\gamma_{i}$ also. But $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}>\alpha_{i}$ for $\alpha_{i}>0$ , contradiction. We conclude that $\beta_{i}>0$ .  

Now from the fact that  

$$
\gamma_{i}(a+b)=\beta_{i}+b\alpha_{i}
$$  

and the fact that $p^{\beta_{i}}$ does not divide $\beta_{i}$ (again for size reasons), we deduce that $p^{\beta_{i}}$ also does not divide $a$ , that is, $\alpha_{i}<\beta_{i}$ for all $i$ and so $a$ divides $b$ . Moreover, the equation above implies that $a$ divides $\beta_{i}$ , so we may write $b=c^{a}$ with $c\geq2$ a positive integer.  

Write $x/a=p/q$ in lowest terms (so $g c d(p,q)=1$ ). Then the original equation becomes $x^{a}p^{b}=b q^{b}$ . Now $p^{b}$ must divide $b$ , which can only occur if $p=1$ . That is, $x$ divides $a$ .  

If $x\neq a$ , then there exists $i$ with $\alpha_{i}\geq\gamma_{i}+1$ , so  

$$
\gamma_{i}(a+b)=\beta_{i}+\alpha_{i}b\geq(\gamma_{i}+1)b
$$  

and so $\gamma_{i}a>b$ . On the other hand, $a$ is divisible by $p_{i}^{\gamma_{i}}$ , so in particular $a\geq\gamma_{i}$ . Thus $a^{2}>b=c^{a}$ , or ${\sqrt{c}}<a^{1/a}$ ; however, $a^{1/a}<{\sqrt{2}}$ for $a\geq5$ , so this can only hold for $c=2$ and $a=3$ , in which case $b=8$ is not divisible by $a$ , contrary to our earlier observation.  

Thus $x=a$ , and from the original equation we get $b=x^{x}$ , as desired.

645,(Miscellaneous Problems),"Problem. Let $m,n$ be integers with $1\leq m<n$ . In their decimal representations, the last three digits of $1978^{m}$ are equal, respectively, to the last three digits of $1978^{n}$ . Find m and $n$ such that $m+n$ is minimal.  

( $20^{t h}$ IMO)  

","Solution. Since $1978^{n}$ and $1978^{m}$ agree in their last three digits, we have  

$$
1978^{n}-1978^{m}=1978^{m}(1978^{n-m}-1)\equiv0{\pmod{10^{3}}}.
$$  

From the decomposition $10^{3}=2^{3}\cdot5^{3}$ and since $1978^{n-m}-1$ is odd we obtain $2^{3}|1978^{m}$ . From $1978=2\cdot989$ , it follows $m\geq3$ .  

Let us write $m+n=(n-m)+2m$ . Our strategy is to minimize $m+n$ by taking $m=3$ and seek the smallest value of $n-m$ such that  

$$
1978^{n-m}\equiv1{\pmod{5^{3}}}.
$$  

Since $(1978,5)=1$ , the problem is to find the order $h$ of the residue-class 1978 (mod 125). It is known that the order $h$ of an inversible residue-class modulo $m$ is a divisor of $\varphi(m)$ , where $\varphi$ is the Euler function. In our case,  

$$
\varphi(125)=5^{2}(5-1)=100.
$$  

Hence, $h|100$ . From $1978^{h}\ \equiv\ 1$ (mod 125) we also have $1978^{h}\ \equiv\ 1$ (mod 5). But $1978^{h}\equiv3^{h}$ (mod 5). Since the order of the residue-class 3 (mod 5) is 4, it follows $4|h$ . Using the congruence $1978\equiv-22$ (mod 125) we obtain:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{1978^{4}\equiv(-22)^{4}\equiv2^{4}\cdot11^{4}\equiv4^{2}\cdot121^{2}}\\ {=(4\cdot(-4))^{2}\equiv(-1)^{2}\equiv256\equiv6\not\equiv1{\pmod{125}}.}\end{array}
$$  

So we rule out the case $h=4$ . Because $h|100$ , the next possibilities are $h=20$ or $h=100$ . By a standard computation we have:  

$$
1978^{20}\equiv6^{5}\equiv2^{5}\cdot3^{5}\equiv32\cdot(-7)\equiv-224\equiv26{\pmod{125}}\not\equiv1{\pmod{125}}.
$$  

Hence we necessarily have: $h=m-n=100$ and $n+m=106$ .

a^{p}\equiv a{\pmod{p}}.
$$  

Fermat’s numbers

Fibonacci sequence  

The sequence defined by $F_{0}=1$ , $F_{1}=1$ and $F_{n+1}=F_{n}+F_{n-1}$ for every positive integer $n$ .  

Floor function  

For a real number $x$ there is a unique integer $n$ such that $n\leq x<n+1$ . We say that $n$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$ or the floor of $x$ and we denote $n=\lfloor x\rfloor$ .  

Fractional part  

The difference $x-\lfloor x\rfloor$ is called the fractional part of $x$ and is denoted by $\{x\}$ .  

Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic  

Any integer $n$ greater than 1 has a unique representation (up to a permutation) as a product of primes.  

Hermite’s Identity  

For any real number $x$ and for any positive integer $n$ ,  

$$
\lfloor x\rfloor+\left\lfloor+{\frac{1}{n}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor+{\frac{2}{n}}\right\rfloor+\dots+\left\lfloor+{\frac{n-1}{n}}\right\rfloor=\lfloor n x\rfloor.
$$  

Legendre’s formula  

For any prime $p$ and any positive integer $n$ ,  

$$
e_{p}(n)=\sum_{i\geq1}\left\lfloor{\frac{n}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor.
$$  

Legendre’s function  

Let $p$ be a prime. For any positive integer $n$ , let $e_{p}(n)$ be the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of $n!$ .  

Legedre’s symbol  

Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $a$ be a positive integer not divisible by $p$ . The Legendre’s symbol of $a$ with respect to $p$ is defined by  

$$
\left({\frac{a}{p}}\right)={\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{1}&{{\mathrm{if~}}a{\mathrm{~is~a~quadratic~residue~mod~}}p}\\ {-1}&{{\mathrm{otherwise}}}\end{array}\right.}
$$  

Linear Diophantine equation  

An equation of the form  

$$
a_{1}x_{1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+a_{n}x_{n}=b,
$$  

where $a_{1},a_{2},\dotsc,a_{n},b$ are fixed integers.  

Linear recurrence of order $k$  

A sequence $x_{0},x_{1},\ldots,x_{2},\ldots.$ of complex numbers defined by  

$$
x_{n}=a_{1}x_{n-1}+a_{2}x_{n-2}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+a_{k}x_{n-k},\quad n\geq k
$$  

where $a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{k}$ are given complex numbers and $x_{0}=\alpha_{0}$ , $x_{1}=\alpha_{1},\ldots$ $x_{k-1}=\alpha_{k-1}$ are also given.  

Lucas’ sequence  

The sequence defined by $L_{0}=2$ , $L_{1}=1$ , $L_{n+1}=L_{n}+L_{n-1}$ for every positive integer $n$ .  

Mersenne’s numbers  

The integers $M_{n}=2^{n}-1$ , $n\geq1$ .  

Mo¨bius function  

The arithmetic function $\mu$ defined by  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mu(n)=\left\{\begin{array}{l l l}{1}&{\mathrm{if}}&{n=1,}\\ {0}&{\mathrm{if}}&{p^{2}|n\mathrm{~for~some~prime~}p>1,}\\ {(-1)^{k}}&{\mathrm{if}}&{n=p_{1}\ldots p_{k},\mathrm{~where~}p_{1},\ldots,p_{k}\mathrm{~are~c~}}\end{array}\right.}\end{array}
$$  

Mo¨bius inversion formula  

Let $f$ be an arithmetic function and let $F$ be its summation function. Then  

$$
f(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}\mu(d)F\left({\frac{n}{d}}\right)
$$  

# Multiplicative function  

An arithmetic function $f\neq0$ with the property that for any relative prime positive integers $m$ and $n$ ,  

$$
f(m n)=f(m)f(n).
$$  

Number of divisors  

For a positive integer $n$ denote by $\tau(n)$ the number of its divisors. It is clear that  

$$
\tau(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}1
$$  

Order modulo $m$  

We say that $a$ has order $d$ modulo $m$ , denoted by $o_{m}(a)=d$ , if $d$ is the smallest positive integer such that $\boldsymbol{a}^{d}\equiv1$ (mod $m$ ).  

# Pell’s equation  

The quadratic equation $u^{2}-D v^{2}=1$ , where $D$ is a positive integer that is not a perfect square.  

Perfect number  

An integer $n\geq2$ with the property that the sum of its divisors is equal to $2n$ .  

Prime Number Theorem  

The relation  

$$
\operatorname*{lim}_{n\to\infty}{\frac{\pi(n)}{\frac{n}{\log n}}}=1,
$$  

where $\pi(n)$ denotes the number of primes $\leq n$ .  

Prime Number Theorem for arithmetic progressions Let $\pi_{r,a}^{(n)}$ be the number of primes in the arithmetic progression $a,a+r,a+$ $2r,a+3r,\ldots$ , less than $n$ , where $a$ and $r$ are relatively prime. Then  

$$
\operatorname*{lim}_{n\to\infty}{\frac{\pi_{r,a}(n)}{\frac{n}{\log n}}}={\frac{1}{\varphi(r)}}
$$  

This was conjectured by Legendre and Dirichlet and proved by de la Vall´ee Poussin.  

Pythagorean equation The Diophantine equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}$ .  

Pythagorean triple  

A triple of the form $(m^{2}-n^{2},2m n,m^{2}+n^{2})$ , where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers.  

Quadratic residue mod $m$  

Let $a$ and $m$ be positive integers such that $g c d(a,m)=1$ . We say that $a$ is a quadratic residue mod $m$ if the convergence $x^{2}\equiv a$ (mod $m$ ) has a solution.  

Quadratic Reciprocity Law of Gauss  

If $p$ and $q$ are distinct odd primes, then  

$$
\left({\frac{q}{p}}\right)\left({\frac{p}{q}}\right)=(-1)^{{\frac{p-1}{2}}\cdot{\frac{q-1}{2}}}
$$  

Sum of divisors  

For a positive integer $n$ denote by $\sigma(n)$ the sum of its positive divisors including 1 and $n$ itself. It is clear that  

$$
\sigma(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}d
$$  

Summation function  

For an arithmetic function $f$ the function $F$ defined by  

$$
F(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}f(d)
$$  

Wilson’s Theorem  

For any prime $p$ , $(p-1)!\equiv-1$ (mod $p$ ).
