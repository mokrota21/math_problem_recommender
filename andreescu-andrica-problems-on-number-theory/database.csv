a) $n^{5}-5n^{3}+4n$ is divisible by 120;   
$b$ ) $n^{2}+3n+5$ is not divisible by 121.  

","Solution. a) $n^{5}-5n^{3}+4n=n(n^{2}-1)(n^{2}-4)$  

$$
=n(n-1)(n+1)(n-2)(n+2).
$$  

the product of five consecutive integers: $n-2$ , $n-1$ , $n$ , $n+1$ , $n+2$ .  

If $n\in\{-2,-1,0,1,2\}$ we get $n^{5}-5n^{3}+4n=0$ and the property holds If $n\geq3$ we can write  

$$
n^{5}-5n^{3}+4n=5!{\binom{n+2}{5}}=120{\binom{n+2}{5}},
$$  

and the conclusion follows.  

If $n\leq-3$ , write $n=-m$ , where $m\geq3$ , and obtain  

$$
n^{5}-5n^{3}+4n=-120{\binom{m+2}{5}},
$$  

and we are done.  

b) Observe that  

$$
n^{2}+3n+5=(n+7)(n-4)+33.
$$  

so that $11|n^{2}+3n+5$ if and only if $11|(n{+}7)(n{-}4)$ . Thus, if $11\div(n+7)(n-4)$ then 11 (and hence 121) does not divide $n^{2}+3n+5$ . So, assume 11 divides $(n+7)(n-4)$ . Then $11|n+7$ or $11|n-4$ ; but then 11 must divide both of $n+7$ and $n-4$ , since $(n+7)-(n-4)=11$ . Thus, $121|(n+7)(n-4)$ . However, $121\nmid33$ . So $121\uparrow n^{2}+3n+5=(n+7)(n-4)+33$ .

Lemma. If a and b are relatively prime positive integers, then there are positive integers u and v such that

a u-b v=1.
$$  

Proof. Consider the numbers  

$$
1\cdot2,\ 2\cdot a,\ldots,(b-1)\cdot a

When divided by $b$ the remainders of these numbers are distinct. Indeed, otherwise we have $k_{1}\neq k_{2}\in\{1,2,\ldots,b-1\}$ such that  

$$
k_{1}a=p_{1}b+r,\quad k_{2}a=p_{2}b+r
$$  

for some integers $p_{1},p_{2}$ . Hence  

$$
(k_{1}-k_{2})a=(p_{1}-p_{2})b\equiv0{\pmod{b}}.
$$  

Since $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime it follows that $|k_{1}-k_{2}|\equiv0$ (mod $b$ ), which is false because $1\leq|k_{1}-k_{2}|<b$ .  

On the other hand, none of the numbers listed in (1) is divisible by $b$ . Indeed, if so, then there is $k\in\{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$ such that  

$$
k\cdot a=p\cdot b{\mathrm{~for~some~integer~}}p.
$$  

Let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of $k$ and $p$ . Hence $k=k_{1}d$ , $p=p_{1}d$ , for some integers $p_{1},k_{1}$ with $g c d(p_{1},k_{1})=1$ . Then $k_{1}a=p_{1}b$ and since $g c d(a,b)=1$ , we have $k_{1}=b$ , $p_{1}=a$ . This is false, because $k_{1}<b$ .  

It follows that one of the numbers from (1) has the remainder 1 when divided by $b$ so there is $u\in\{1,2,\dotsc,b-1\}$ such that $a u=b v+1$ and the lemma is proved.

Because $g c d(a,b)=1$ using the lemma, there are positive integers $u$ and $v$ such that $a u-b v=1$ . Hence

for some integers $p_{1},p_{2}$ . Hence  

$$
(k_{1}-k_{2})a=(p_{1}-p_{2})b\equiv0{\pmod{b}}.
$$  

Since $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime it follows that $|k_{1}-k_{2}|\equiv0$ (mod $b$ ), which is false because $1\leq|k_{1}-k_{2}|<b$ .  

On the other hand, none of the numbers listed in (1) is divisible by $b$ . Indeed, if so, then there is $k\in\{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$ such that  

$$
k\cdot a=p\cdot b{\mathrm{~for~some~integer~}}p.
$$  

Let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of $k$ and $p$ . Hence $k=k_{1}d$ , $p=p_{1}d$ , for some integers $p_{1},k_{1}$ with $g c d(p_{1},k_{1})=1$ . Then $k_{1}a=p_{1}b$ and since $g c d(a,b)=1$ , we have $k_{1}=b$ , $p_{1}=a$ . This is false, because $k_{1}<b$ .  

It follows that one of the numbers from (1) has the remainder 1 when divided by $b$ so there is $u\in\{1,2,\dotsc,b-1\}$ such that $a u=b v+1$ and the lemma is proved.  

We prove now that the system  

$$
\left\{{\begin{array}{l}{a x-y z-c=0}\\ {b x-y t+d=0}\end{array}}\right.
$$  

with $a,b,c,d$ nonnegative integers and $g c d(a,b)=1$ has at least a solution in nonnegative integers.  

Because $g c d(a,b)=1$ using the lemma, there are positive integers $u$ and $v$ such that $a u-b v=1$ . Hence  

$$
x=c u+d v,\quad y=a d+b c,\quad z=v,\quad t=u,
$$  

is a solution to the system.

","Solution. Answer: triples of the form $(k,k,k)$ or $(k,2k,3k)$ or their permutations.  

Let $g$ be the positive greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ . Then $g^{3}$ divides $a^{2}b$ , so $g^{3}$ divides $a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}$ , and $g$ divides $c$ . Thus, the gcd of any two of $a,b,c$ is the $g c d$ of all three.

$$
l^{2}m^{2}n^{2}|(l^{3}+m^{3}+n^{3}).

We will prove that $(l,m,n)$ is either (1,1,1) or a permutation of (1,2,3). Assume without loss of generality that $l\geq m\geq n$ . We have  

$$
3l^{3}\ge l^{3}+m^{3}+n^{3}\ge l^{2}m^{2}n^{2},

# Proposed problems  

","Problem. A table with m rows and n columns has all entries $-1$ or 1 such that for each row and each column the product of entries is $-1$ . Prove that m and n have the same parity.  

Solution. We compute the product $P$ of the $m\cdot n$ entries in two ways, by rows and by columns, respectively:  

$$
P=\underbrace{(-1)(-1)\dots(-1)}_{m\ t i m e s}=(-1)^{m}=(-1)^{n}=\underbrace{(-1)(-1)\dots(-1)}_{n\ t i m e s}.
$$  

The conclusion now follows.  

We will show such a table for $m=3$ and $n=5$ .

# (1997 Czech and Slovak Mathematical Olympiad)  

Solution. Let $p_{k}$ be the $k$ -th prime number, $k\geq1$ . Set $a_{1}=2$ . For $n\geq1$ , let $\boldsymbol a_{n+1}$ be the least integer greater than $a_{n}$ that is congruent to $-k$ modulo $p_{k+1}$ for all $k\leq n$ . Such an integer exists by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Thus, for all $k\geq0$ , $k+a_{n}\equiv0{\pmod{p_{k+1}}}$ for $n\geq k+1$ . Then at most $k+1$ values in the sequence $\left\{k+a_{n}\right\}$ can be prime; from the $k+2$ - th term onward, the values are nontrivial multiples of $p_{k+1}$ and must be composite. This completes the proof.

77,(Divisibility)->(Numerical systems)->(Divisibility criteria in the decimal system),"Problem. Find all integers written as $\overline{{a b c d}}$ in decimal representation and dcba in base 7.  

","Solution. We have  

$$
\overline{{a b c d}}_{(10)}=\overline{{d c b a}}_{(7)}\Leftrightarrow999a+93b=39c+342d\Leftrightarrow333a+31b=13c+114d,
$$  

hence $b\equiv c$ (mod 3). As $b,c\in\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ , the possibilities are:  

i) $b=c$ ;   
ii) $b=c+3$ ;   
iii) $b+3=c$ .  

In the first case we must have $a=2a^{\prime}$ , $d=3d^{\prime}$ , $37a^{\prime}+b=19d^{\prime}$ , $d^{\prime}=2$ . Hence $a^{\prime}=1$ , $a=2$ , $d=6$ , $b=1$ , $c=1$ , and the number $\overline{{a b c d}}$ is 2116.  

In the other cases $a$ has to be odd. Considering $a=1$ , $3$ or 5 we obtain no solutions.

(1996 German Mathematical Olympiad)  

","Solution. Let $n$ be the integer such that $2^{n-1}\leq k<2^{n}$ . For $n\leq6$ the result is immediate, so assume $n>6$ .  

Let $S$ be the set of nonnegative integers less than $10^{n}$ whose decimal digits are all $0$ or 1. Since $|S|=2^{n}>k$ , we can find two elements $a<b$ of $S$ which are congruent modulo $k$ , and $b-a$ only has the digits 8, $9$ , $0$ , $^{1}$ in its decimal representation. On the other hand,  

$$
b-a\leq1+10+\cdots+10^{n-1}<10^{n}<16^{n-1}\leq k^{4};
$$  

hence $b-a$ is the desired multiple.
